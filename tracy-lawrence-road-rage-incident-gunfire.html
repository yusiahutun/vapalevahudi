Back in 1992, on the very day that he finished recording his debut album Sticks and Stones, the then-newcomer came face to face with three armed young men in a hotel parking lot. In the ensuing struggle, Lawrence was shot four times at close range, but he went on to make a full recovery.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top Country Songs of 2021, Ranked</h2><p>You'll find much more than just the Top 10 Country Songs of 2021 on this list.
