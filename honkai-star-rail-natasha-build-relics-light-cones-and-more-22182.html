<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Relics, Light Cones, And More</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>The newest turn-based RPG from HoYoverse is Honkai Star Rail, which highlights the significance of creating teams and individual character loadouts. One of the various 4-star characters that players can acquire is Natasha, a competent physician who hails from the Underworld city of Belobog. Natasha possesses a distinct set of skills that make her an invaluable addition to any team, and she specializes in healing.</p><p>To find out more about Natasha's optimal configuration and her abilities in Honkai Star Rail, keep reading. As of the time of writing, Natasha's tier has been updated to S, which means she's definitely worth leveling up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.gurugamer.com/resize/740x-/2023/05/05/783a7-16831194837528-1920-8829.jpg><h2>About Natasha</h2><p>Players have the chance to acquire Natasha as a 4-star character through the game's gacha system or by finishing a portion of the Jarilo-VI campaign. Natasha is a Path of Abundance adherent who deals physical damage, and she has the ability to restore the health of her allies using both her ultimate move and skill. Her most effective setup can be divided into subcategories and comprises:</p><h2>1. Light Cones</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.gurugamer.com/resize/740x-/2023/05/05/52679-16831192539030-1920-fd73.jpg><p>Natasha's role in the team determines the three recommended Light Cones:</p><li>Time Waits for No One: This Light Cone is a 5-star and raises Natasha's maximum HP and outgoing healing by a predetermined value. It's the optimal choice as her healing capability is influenced by her HP. Additionally, it provides a bonus to damage based on the HP regenerated.</li><li>Post-Op Conversation: This 4-star Light Cone is Natasha's unique equipment, and it can only be obtained via the gacha system. The Light Cone enhances her energy regeneration by 8% and her total healing output via ultimate by an extra 12%, enabling her to use AoE heals more rapidly.</li><li>Cornucopia: This Light Cone has a rating of 3-star and is a good option for players who don't spend money on the game. Cornucopia merely raises Natasha's healing by 12% on both her skill and ultimate. The skill can be further improved up to a value of 24% when completely superimposed.</li><h2>2. Relics and Ornaments</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.gurugamer.com/resize/740x-/2023/05/05/e536d-16831193667989-1920-332a.jpg><p>It is advised to equip Natasha with the Passerby of the Wandering Cloud Relic set in Honkai Star Rail, which can be obtained by battling several bosses. This specific set increases her outgoing healing by 10%. Moreover, using four of these Relics will activate another passive that restores one skill point at the beginning of a battle.</p><p>For Ornaments, it is recommended to use the Fleet of the Ageless set, which enhances Natasha's maximum HP by 12% and grants an 8% attack buff to all allies when her speed exceeds 120.</p><p>When selecting Relics, prioritize those that have values in both HP and Outgoing Healing.</p><h2>3. Abilities to prioritize</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.gurugamer.com/resize/740x-/2023/05/05/42fd0-16831194431983-1920-9dfe.jpg><p>Although Natasha's basic attack can inflict considerable Physical damage, it's essential to focus on her skill and ultimate abilities for healing purposes. It's crucial to increase the level of her abilities and passives to realize her complete potential.</p><h3>Basic ATK</h3><p>Deals Physical DMG equal to 50% of Natasha's ATK to a single enemy.</p><h3>Skill: Love, Heal, and Choose</h3><p>Heals a single ally for 9% of Natasha's Max HP plus 60. Heals the ally for another 6% of Natasha's Max HP plus 40 at the beginning of each turn for 2 turn(s).</p><h3>Ultimate: Gift of Rebirth</h3><p>Heals all allies for 11.1% of Natasha's Max HP plus 74.</p><h3>Passive: Innervation</h3><p>When healing allies with HP values at 30% of their Max HP or lower, increases Natasha's Outgoing Healing by 25%.</p><h3>Technique: Hypnosis Research</h3><p>Immediately attacks the enemy. After entering battle, deals Physical DMG equal to 80% of Natasha's ATK to a random enemy, with a 100% base chance to Weaken all enemies. Enemies that are Weakened deal 30% less DMG to allies for 1 turn(s).</p><h3>Ascension passives</h3><ul><li>Healer (Ascension 2): Natasha's Outgoing Healing increases by 10%.</li><li>Soothe (Ascension 4): Natasha's Skill removes 1 debuff(s) from an ally.</li><li>Recuperation (Ascension 6): Increases the duration of her Skill's continuous healing effect for 1 turn(s).</li></ul><h2>4. Eidolons</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.gurugamer.com/resize/740x-/2023/05/05/6717a-16831193229894-1920-a851.jpg><p>Natasha, like every character in Honkai Star Rail, has access to Eidolons, which enable players to merge duplicates of the same character to unlock additional abilities. There are six Eidolons that Natasha can unlock, including:</p><ul><li>Pharmacology Expertise: Restores a fixed portion of HP to herself after being damaged once per battle.</li><li>Clinical Research: Provides continuous healing to all allies with 30% or less HP for one turn after using ultimate. Also, it recovers a fixed amount of HP per turn for those units.</li><li>The Right Cure: Increases skill level by two points, up to a maximum of 15.</li><li>Miracle Cure: Generates five Energy after being attacked.</li><li>Preventative Treatment: Increases ultimate level by two points. It caps out at 15.</li><li>Doctor's Grace: Basic attack now deals extra physical damage equal to 40% of max HP.</li></ul><p>Each Eidolon unlocked enhances Natasha's abilities and is a valuable investment. However, those players who intend to use Natasha solely as a healer don't need to worry about the final Eidolon.</p><p><strong>>>> Read more:&nbsp;<a href=#>Best Support Characters In Honkai: Star Rail, Ranked</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifpafCqK3Mnqlnm5%2BifK67waKjnmWXlrqmv46hpqejkZ56tMDAq2SrmZmheq%2Bt05qqoZldl8KquMNmqZ6kmZjAbrjIoJ%2BtZZOku6a%2FjJqlnWWdpL%2BmeZFraHFq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./motley-crue-star-nikki-sixx-triumphs-in-lawsuit-over-vans.html><span>←</span><span>Motley Crue Star, Nikki Sixx, Triumphs In Lawsuit Over Vans</span></a>
