The figure dropped to 35.3 billion in 2022, mainly due to lockdowns in Chinese cities to contain Covid-19.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But even before the pandemic, buses were falling out of favour with as China’s growing middle class chose to drive, take the underground or use ride-hailing and bike-share services. In 2019, passengers took 69.2 billion bus trips, a drop of more than 10 per cent from peak levels.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/04/14/web.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:49</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Baidu wins permits to offer fully driverless robotaxi service in Beijing</p><p>Baidu wins permits to offer fully driverless robotaxi service in Beijing</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many Chinese bus companies have also had to cope with rising labour costs. Ageing staff, higher fuel prices and growing maintenance costs have made them increasingly dependent on financial support from local governments.</p>But with the current economic downturn causing <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">tax and land sales revenue to plunge</span></a> in many Chinese cities, regional governments have been forced to cut expenses, including subsidies to local bus operators.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Last week, a bus company serving over 1 million residents in Pidu district of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, apologised to its staff for delaying salary payments.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The delay was “due to various factors that have caused difficulties in the company’s financial turnover”, the company said in a memo circulating on Chinese social media platforms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An official at Chengdu’s transport department confirmed that the memo was genuine, adding that the company had managed to pay all staff members after the local government stepped in.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The government has bought some transport services from the company, so it has money to pay its staff.

It was being kept afloat by huge government financial aid, which totalled 3.3 billion yuan in 2022.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s Didi returns to profit for the first time since ill-fated IPO</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its current liquidity crunch was temporarily resolved as the Tianjin Municipal Finance Bureau pumped 700 million yuan into the company on September 18. Many employees said they received their salaries and social insurance after the cash injection. But it is not clear how the company will stop the bleeding.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some Chinese cities have started looking for ways to rescue their bus operators. The southern metropolis of Guangzhou and the city of Lanzhou in northwestern China have announced they will increase bus fares from 1 yuan to 2 yuan. Some cities also plan to charge more for longer and dedicated routes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Many cities in the Yangtze River Delta are using big data technology to optimise bus routes and operating hours.
