The core of scallion pancakes [and, updated to add, other flatbreads such as parathas, parottas, roti canai, and malawach] is also a simple, yeast-free, dough, also kneaded and left to rest before you roll it out. But instead of frying them right away, you brush them with oil, sprinkle them with scallions (for scallion pancakes), and roll the pancake into a tight cigar, and then the cigar into a snail. This snail of wound dough is left to rest again, and then rolled into the final pancake. The hidden layers of flour and oil help the layers lift and separate into flaky layers as you fry the pancakes. And this layering, it turned out, was exactly what my one-dimensional yogurt flatbreads were missing.</p><p><a title="brush very thinly with butter or oil" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834268333_34b700101f_n.jpg alt="brush very thinly with butter or oil" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="roll into a cigar" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834806441_e7b14723d0_n.jpg alt="roll into a cigar" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="can cover them with your empty bowl" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49835113657_bf0e9fede6_n.jpg alt="can cover them with your empty bowl" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="ready to roll after second rest" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834268088_6ef37b45f7_n.jpg alt="ready to roll after second rest" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>From the outside, they look like any other tender, stretchy flatbread, but as you tear a piece off, an inner accordion emerges. And waft of buttered air. They deflate fairly fast but stay puffed (while you cook the rest or if you wish to rewarm them) in a 300 degree oven. And since this is one of the first recipes I worked on with a full apartment of noise vs. the relative peace of my Before work life — when I’d work on things throughout the afternoon and share at dinner — I had a lot of live commentary like “These are good!” And “I want more!” and “Wow, so puffy!” And “When are going to make them again?” Thus, you could call this a pre-approved recipe. I can’t wait to see how yours come out.</p><p><a title="they puff while they fry" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834805916_82ba893b39_n.jpg alt="they puff while they fry" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="layered yogurt flatbreads" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834267528_a7db9cd65d_n.jpg alt="layered yogurt flatbreads" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="layered yogurt flatbreads" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834805556_7f70c92ac2_n.jpg alt="layered yogurt flatbreads" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a title="layered yogurt flatbreads" href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834805286_c6dc991ca9_n.jpg alt="layered yogurt flatbreads" width=320 height=213 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h5>Previously</h5><p><b>Six months ago:</b> <a href=#>White Bean Soup with Crispy Kale</a><br><b>One year ago:</b> <a href=#>Braised Ginger Meatballs in Coconut Broth</a><br><b>Two years ago:</b> <a href=#>Fig Newtons</a> and <a href=#>Cripsy Tofu Pad Thai</a><br><b>Three years ago:</b> <a href=#>Granola Bark</a><br><b>Four years ago:</b> <a href=#>Caramelized Brown Sugar Oranges with Yogurt</a> and <a href=#>Potato Pizza, Even Better</a><br><b>Five years ago:</b> <a href=#>Why You Should Always Toast Your Nuts (Please!)</a> and <a href=#>Obsessively Good Avocado-Cucumber Salad</a><br><b>Six years ago:</b> <a href=#>Dark Chocolate Coconut Macaroons</a> and <a href=#>Baked Eggs with Spinach and Mushrooms</a><br><b>Seven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Spinach and Smashed Egg Toast</a> and <a href=#>Bee Sting Cake</a><br><b>Eight years ago:</b> <a href=#>Over-the-Top Mushroom Quiche</a> and <a href=#>Banana Bread Crepe Cake with Butterscotch</a><br><b>Nine years ago:</b> <a href=#>Blackberry and Coconut Macaroon Tart</a><br><b>Ten years ago:</b> <a href=#>Baked Kale Chips</a> and <a href=#>Almond Macaroon Torte with Chocolate Frosting</a><br><b>Eleven years ago:</b> <a href=#>Artichoke-Olive Crostini</a> and <a href=#>Chocolate Caramel Crackers</a><br><b>Twelve years ago:</b> <a href=#>Spring Panzanella</a> and <a href=#>Lemon Yogurt Anything Cake</a><br><b>Thirteen years ago:</b> <a href=#>Arborio Rice Pudding</a> and <a href=#>Gnocchi with a Grater</a></p><p style="border-bottom:1px dashed #6b7794"></p><h3 class="p-name jetpack-recipe-title fn" itemprop=name>Layered Yogurt Flatbreads</h3><ul class=jetpack-recipe-meta><li class="jetpack-recipe-servings p-yield yield" itemprop=recipeYield><strong>Servings: </strong>8 flatbreads</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-time><strong>Time:</strong> <span class=time>90 minutes, mostly rest time</span></li><li class=jetpack-recipe-source><strong>Source: </strong>Smitten Kitchen</li><li class=jetpack-recipe-print><a href=#>Print</a></li></ul>Heap these flatbreads with a simple salad, an egg, a saute of vegetables, or eat them as my kids do, warm from the pan with a little extra butter on top. Feel free to use this recipe as a springboard for other flavors — garlic, herbs, or spices.<p><strong>Update, 6/5/20:</strong> What I’m learning from your comments is that yogurt varies widely in how loose it is and if yours is on the wetter side, you may not need any added water here. So, I am updating the recipe to only add water as needed. I hope this resolves any issues with sticky dough. Stick dough is fine when it first comes together — the goal, in fact — but it should absorb and become easy to roll as it rests; check my pictures of each step for reference.</p><ul><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 cups (260 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 teaspoons kosher salt (I use Diamond, use half of another brand, here’s <a href=#>why</a>)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 teaspoon baking powder</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>1 cup plain, full- or low-fat yogurt (Greek or regular)</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>2 to 4 tablespoons water</li><li class="jetpack-recipe-ingredient p-ingredient ingredient" itemprop=recipeIngredient>4 tablespoons melted, unsalted butter, olive oil, coconut oil, or ghee (for assembly)</li></ul>Make dough: Combine flour, salt, and baking powder in a large bowl. Add yogurt and [updated to edit] stir to combine — you’ll have to mash it a bit to get it mixed in. If needed, add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring thoroughly to combine, until flour-yogurt mixture forms large clumps. For plain, non-Greek yogurt, you might need 2 to 3 tablespoons of water total; for Greek, you might need up to 4 tablespoons; for a thinner or homemade yogurt, you might need no water at all. Mix as best as you can with a spoon and then, if you can reach your hands into the bowl, use them to bring the dough together into a rough ball. Transfer — along with any unmixed bits — to your counter and knead into a smooth ball, about 1 to 2 minutes. Lightly flour a spot on the counter, place the ball of dough on top of it, and upend the empty bowl over it. Let rest for 30 minutes.<p>Layer dough: Divide dough into 8 wedges. Working with one at a time, very lightly flour your counter and roll out each into a round or oblong shape as thin as it will go — usually about 6″ in diameter. Brush thinly with 2 teaspoons butter or oil. Roll dough away from you into a thin cylinder, then wind each cylinder into a coil (it will look like a sideways snail). Place each coil of dough back on a floured spot and cover, resting for another 15 to 20 minutes; repeat with remaining pieces of dough.</p><p>Heat your oven to 300 degrees F and have a big baking sheet ready. (Flatbreads fully cook on stove, but you can keep them warm and lightly puffed in the oven.)</p><p>Cook flatbreads: Working with one coil at a time, roll into a thin round (about 5″). Brush the top with more butter, you can be a bit more generous here. Repeat with as many flatbreads as you think you can fit in your pan; leave the remaining coils continue to rest, covered.</p><p>Warm a frying pan over medium-low heat. Flip flatbread butter-side-down onto pan and cook until a deep golden brown underneath, about 5 minutes. Brush the top with more butter as it cooks on the first side, then flip and continue cooking until the same deep golden brown on the second. Transfer to baking sheet and place in oven to keep warm. Continue this process with the remaining coils and flatbreads.</p><p><strong>Do ahead:</strong> These layered yogurt flatbreads keep perfectly in the fridge; I wrap mine in foil. Rewarm in a 300-degree oven for about 10 minutes.</p><h3 class=sd-title>Share this:</h3><ul><li class=share-twitter><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-twitter-44558 class="share-twitter sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Twitter"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=share-facebook><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared=sharing-facebook-44558 class="share-facebook sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to share on Facebook"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=share-email><a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-shared class="share-email sd-button share-icon" href=# title="Click to email a link to a friend" data-email-share-error-title="Do you have email set up?" data-email-share-error-text="If you're having problems sharing via email, you might not have email set up for your browser.
