Now, in her professional life, Sweeney has similarly received backlash for taking on nude scenes as Cassie Howard in HBO's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Euphoria</a>. “You have a character that goes through the scrutiny of being a sexualized person at school and then an audience that does the same thing,”&nbsp;she said. “I think it’s ridiculous. I’m an artist, I play characters. It makes me want to play characters that piss people off more,”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I have big boobs, I’m blonde, and that’s all I have," Sweeney added, referring to the biggest misconception people have about her.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sweeney then received more criticism online for complaining about her body, but fans were quick to jump to the actress's defense. One Twitter user wrote, "Women, from the time they reach consciousness, are shamed for simply existing so idk why it’s so hard for people to understand that a child developing breast earlier would lead to scrutiny or feelings of insecurity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another fan backed Sweeney's statement writing, "anyone mocking this probably wasn’t catcalled at 10/11 and wasn’t told to cover up for wearing the same things other kids were allowed to wear. when your body becomes sexualized as a child you can start to hate it and blame yourself. it can be honestly awful."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last year, Sweeney told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Independent</a>, that she didn't feel her work on the hit teen show was taken seriously because all of the focus was on her nudity. “I’m very proud of my work in&nbsp;Euphoria. I thought it was a great performance. But no one talks about it because I got naked.”<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I do&nbsp;The White Lotus,&nbsp;and all of a sudden, critics are paying attention," she added. "People are loving me. They’re going, ‘Oh my God, what’s she doing next?’ I was like, ‘Did you not see that in&nbsp;Euphoria? Did you not see that in&nbsp;The Handmaid’s Tale?'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570rKbp52pYsC4scSnnLJlmaPBpr7VopywZZKksbp5xK6noaeinq5uutSdnGark5q7pr%2BMcGpvcWVrhg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taika-waititi-explains-pronounce-name-html.html><span>←</span><span>Taika Waititi Explains How to Pronounce His Name</span></a>
