However, the property had stood empty for 40 years, and with no electricity, heating or running water, they have been renovating it as part of their TV show ever since.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/85e5753e2753-escape-to-the-chateau-family.jpg><h2>Can you tour the&nbsp;Escape to the Chateau castle?</h2><p id=ezejjVeSb057 data-wc=89>Yes, you can! Dick and Angel do a £230 day tour of the chateau, which includes transport to and from Laval, a delicious lunch with wine and a tour of the grounds, with an afternoon tea to finish. The event, which is currently not in operation due to COVID-19, also features a guided tour from the sous-sol (basement) up five floors to the grenier (attic), as well as a chat with the couple about how they ended up there, life in France and secrets of making the television series.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbyusdJoaWlqYmWAc4OQbG1qbGhksrSvwKmcZqyfYsGpsYycn5qslZbCbq%2FArKulnV2YvLTAjK2mZquklsZw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./winter-skirt-outfits-8357628.html><span>←</span><span>12 Winter Skirt Outfits That Won't Leave You Freezing</span></a>
