However, <a href=#>one tablespoon</a> contains 98 calories and is packed with benefits. “It is high in omega-3, an essential fatty acid that has anti-inflammatory properties,” Brenda Peralta, RD, explains to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">She Finds</a>.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Omega-3 fatty acids <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have been shown</a> to reduce inflammation that might otherwise lead to skin ulcers, psoriasis, and eczema. This means you can protect your youthful glow and smooth skin with a little nut butter. Although it may sound strange at first, coffee is an ideal drink to mix with it. Along with tasting great together, <a href=#>coffee has health perks</a> of its own. It contains an antioxidant called <a href=#>chlorogenic acid</a>, which balances blood sugar and lowers diabetes risk.</p><p>Peralta suggests putting a tablespoon of almond butter in your regular coffee and sprinkling it with a dash of cinnamon or a drop or two of vanilla extract. The heat from the coffee will make the almond butter dissolve easily, so you don’t have to worry about sipping a glob of it in your drink. You can also pour the ingredients into a blender with about two tablespoons of your favorite milk to make a yummy coffee smoothie.&nbsp;</p><p>Trying this at home myself, I made a latte by brewing two shots of espresso and stirring in a tablespoon of the nut butter. I used a smooth variety to make sure it fully combined without leaving behind any tiny pieces of almonds. Next, I added frothy steamed milk and topped it with a pinch of cinnamon.</p><p>To no surprise, the almond butter added a nuttiness to my latte. It also balanced well with the bitter chocolatey taste of espresso and sweetness of milk. It reminded me of a Starbucks drink because of the unique flavor combo, which turned out to be more delicious than I expected.</p><p>As far as skin benefits go, only time will tell if drinking this concoction regularly protects me from signs of aging. However, I’ll gladly put almond butter in my coffee to jazz it up now and then regardless!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/Almond-butter-coffee.jpg><p>If you’re not a fan of almond butter or have a nut allergy, Peralta adds that you can pour in some <a href=#>soy milk</a> in your drink to protect aging skin. “Some studies have found that women who incorporated soy into their diet improved skin and wrinkles,” she says.</p><p>Research published in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Functional Foods in Health and Disease</a> supports this by mentioning 1/2 cup (125 ml) of soy milk daily reduced wrinkles and improved urinary health in postmenopausal women after eight weeks. Of course, you can drink soy milk on its own, but try mixing it with coffee for a caffeine boost that will also do wonders for your skin!</p><p>Think of<strong> </strong>coffee as a blank canvas and get creative with how you increase its benefits. Aside from almond butter or soy milk, other add-ins like <a href=#>hot sauce</a>, <a href=#>cocoa powder</a>, and <a href=#>protein powder</a> each offer amazing health-boosting effects that make them worth trying!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJomKesmWKuqLXNoGaapqSeeqKzyKeeZpmcoryvsIybrK2slad6pLvFn5ye</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coastal-cowgirl-home-decor.html><span>←</span><span>The Best Coastal Cowgirl Home Decor from Amazon and Walmart</span></a>
