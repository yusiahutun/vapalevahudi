I know many of you have heard rumors that I have been sick, well I have, but I've been diagnosed with cancer. I just had my first treatment today," Brown says, lifting his arm to show an orange bandage. The singer is optimistic and looks to be as healthy as ever.</p><p>"I'm going to beat it with chemo and radiation, but I want to thank you for your prayers and support," he furthers. "I'm going to beat this little thing called cancer. I'm going to be alright within the next, well, four months, ok? I'll see you next year."</p><p>Brown -- a member of the Browns family trio -- is known for hits such as 'Pop a Top' and 'I Don't Want to Have to Marry You.' He joined with his sisters, Maxine and Bonnie, in the 1950s, and their biggest hit, 'The Three Bells,' climbed the Billboard Country charts, where it stayed for 10 weeks. They joined the Opry in 1963.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Brown and his family during this time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo6GdYrKlecGrprCmXaHCr7OMnJinm5WnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-the-breast-cancer-survivor-who-has-run-more-than-300-marathons-and-counting.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Breast Cancer Survivor Who Has Run More Than 300 Marathons</span></a>
