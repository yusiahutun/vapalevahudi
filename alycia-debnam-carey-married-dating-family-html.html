She has a career that people wish to have.</p><p dir=ltr>Alycia Jasmin Debnam-Carey has worked in long-running series like-&nbsp;The 100 and Fear Of The Walking Dead. As far as we know, this gorgeous actress has been in a relationship but fans wonder if she is straight or attracted to women as well.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Her Sexuality And Dating Life</h2><p dir=ltr>The 27-year-old actress had speculations about her sexuality after her on-screen character on the 100 “Commander (Heda) Lexa” shared romantic and passionate feelings for “Clarke”. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>After the scenes, fans started speculating if the actress was into women in real life,&nbsp;but the actress never came forward to clear out speculations. We believe that she is straight as giving life to a character and story is a part of an actor’s job. The confusion of fans just goes on to show how amazing of an actress she is.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Talking about her relationships and dating history she has been known to date her school-time friend Marcus Castrus. Both of them went to the same school and as every start of a love story, they fell in love. But both of them fell off shortly due to some unknown reasons.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Alycia Debnam-Carey with boyfriend&nbsp;Marcus Castrus</strong> (Photo:&nbsp;answersafrica.com)</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify>Debnam has never shared details about her personal life so it’s hard to know the reason for the two’s breakup. However, there were speculations that Marcus had cheated but we cannot confirm this news.&nbsp;For those wondering, there is no other news of the actress dating life so it is safe to say that she is single.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Career That People Dream Of</h2><p dir=ltr>The Australian actress has shared an amazing career so far. She has starred in some amazing series running for a long time and has a strong fan base. The actress holds a following of 3 million on Instagram. The actress has been in front of cameras almost all her life. Her acting journey started in 2003 when she starred in “Martha’s New Coat”.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-600 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>From childhood, she was destined to have an amazing career and had an early start. Her career has never seen a break since. Some of the works she is known for and has won awards are for being “Lexa” in “The 100” and “Alicia Clark” in “Fear of the Walking Dead."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>.<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@DebnamCarey</a> is taking over our Instagram (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@FearTWD</a>) right now!</p><p>Don't miss her on a new <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">#FearTWD</a> tonight at 9/8c. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/RbP0TqsQ5W</a> — FearTWD (@FearTWD) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 24, 2021</a></p><p dir=ltr>The actress won her award for her amazing performance in 100 and has been nominated for her performance in&nbsp;The Fear Of The Walking Dead as well.</p><p dir=ltr style=text-align:justify><strong>Similar Journey:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Danielle Macdonald Boyfriend, Family, Net Worth</a></p><h2 dir=ltr>Is Alycia Debnam Carey A Mother? Is She Engaged</h2><p dir=ltr>The simple answer is No. The speculations were made after she was seen with a baby bump but it was to get ready for her character in one of her movies.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Nevertheless, She has a mother in real life who&nbsp;is a Hollywood writer, and apparently, it was her mother's influence&nbsp;that showed her the journey of becoming an actress. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-601 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p dir=ltr>She has not previously been engaged or married but we would love to see her opening a new chapter in her life when she is ready to do so.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>How Much Money Does She Make?</h2><p dir=ltr>There is no doubt this amazing actress is so passionate about her work and career. And having an amazing set of art that people appreciate means being paid your worth for it. Reportedly, the actress is just 27 years of age and&nbsp;has made a net worth of over&nbsp;$1&nbsp;million.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Her salary from her recent show has not been discussed anywhere, but looking at the amount of talent,&nbsp;she sure is getting paid generously.</p><p dir=ltr>She can be recently seen on the new season of "The Fear Of The Walking Dead".
