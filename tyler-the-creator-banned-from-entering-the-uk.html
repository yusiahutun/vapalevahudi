Busta Rhymes and Snoop Dogg have both been excluded from the country in the past, because of convictions for criminal offences in the US.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>However, objections to Tyler have been based not on criminal behaviour, but rather on the content of his lyrics. Earlier this month <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the Californian rapper cancelled the Australian leg of his world tour</a> after a feminist group launched a petition to have him denied a visa to enter the country. The group, Collective Shout, cited objections to lyrics that include references to rape and violence against women, as well as historic behaviour on earlier tours.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>When Tyler was booked to play Glastonbury in 2013, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a similar petition was launched in the UK</a> accusing Tyler of “normalising, and even glamorising, rape in his rap lyrics.” It attracted 762 signatures and the rapper went on to play his set with no disruption. That same year, again in Australia, Tyler was reported to the police after launching into <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">a derogatory tirade against Talitha Stone</a>, a member of Collective Shout, which was also then campaigning against his appearance in the country.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Stone, who was in the crowd at the gig where Tyler made his comments, filmed him saying: “Fucking bitch, I wish she could hear me call her a bitch, too, fucking whore. Yeah, I got a sold-out show right now bitch. Hey this fucking song is dedicated to you, you fucking cunt.”</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Complaints about Tyler seem to stem largely from songs on his self-produced 2009 mixtape Bastard, which includes lines such as “<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">you call this shit rape but I think that rape’s fun</a>” as well as references to raping Goldilocks and committing suicide. Most of that record was written when Tyler was a teenager and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">he has since written about how he’s moved on from the sentiments expressed</a> on it.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The Home Office does not usually comment on individual cases where a person is refused entry to the UK. In a terse statement, spokesperson said: “Coming to the UK is a privilege, and we expect those who come here to respect our shared values.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>“The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good or if their exclusion is justified on public policy grounds.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaKWlqLake5FpaG5nkaq0cH6WaKuypJWnerW0xGaaq52RqbyzecGapaedlGKzs7vMZpynrJWntq%2BzjK2fnmWloA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-law-firm-boies-schiller-flexner-loses-100-attorneys-advised-harvey-weinstein-html.html><span>←</span><span>Top law firm Boies Schiller Flexner loses 100 attorneys after it advised Harvey Weinstein</span></a>
