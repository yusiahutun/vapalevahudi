We have never seen Eva Marcille the way we saw her on Sunday's episode of &#34;The Real Housewives of Atlanta.&#34; She unloaded on Marlo Hampton after weeks and weeks of letting Marlo's jabs fly, and we have to admit, it was kind of amazing.
So the girls are still in Tokyo for Eva's bachelorette party, and the new hour picked up where we left off -- with NeNe Leakes erupting on Tanya Sam before storming out of the restaurant and taking a taxi home."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That's when shots started getting fired.</p><p>Eva told the ladies they were going to the red-light district to sing karaoke that night, and <strong><a href=#>Kandi Burruss</a></strong> asked if sneaker wedges were appropriate. Eva sassily shot down the idea.</p><p>"I know you ain't talking, Eva! Your Birkenstock-wearing ass," Marlo shouted. Taken aback, Eva urged Marlo not to come for her, her shoes, her fashion or anything else for that matter.</p><p>"Girl, you got me all the way twisted. I'm on my motherf--king runway right now. Stop it," the former model said, showing off her $1,200 flats.</p><p>Marlo whispered to herself, "Now you just done got the plug on it. Now, chill out."</p><p>"Ain't nobody got no plug!" Eva fired back. "She been doing this. I went from on the runway to off the runway every minute of 5'7". Been doing it since 18, and I'm every minute of 33."</p><p>Eva had that sparkle in her eye; she was not gonna stop there. She told Marlo she'd "tried to sit on [her] yoga mat" but that she had officially been pushed too far. "Put your wig down and leave me alone!" she shouted. Marlo stood up to face her, and the ladies lost their minds.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:07e2d63c-10d9-58aa-a1ed-6ddf229f0cd1 data-container-ref=toofab:article:eea3b476-310a-542d-91d0-7ef321158e2d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/6d/5by4/2019/01/18/6d5b8429ccdb5a9bb8595b84d3e37485_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'RHOA' Fight of the Night: Eva Accuses Porsha of 'Character Assassination' Before NeNe Explodes on Tanya</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Throughout the season, Marlo has said Eva has "no character," called her "basic," criticized her fashion sense, told her she needed to lose 10 pounds (during her wedding dress fitting), among other things. Needless to say, Eva had lots of pent up anger, and Marlo had very little ammo left.</p><p>Marlo told Eva everything she's worn on the runway is in her closet, which Eva countered with, "because you're older than me, Marlo!" She insisted Eva "pulls" and "borrows" all her designer clothing. "You can't fit into nothing on the runway now," she added.</p><p>"And you fit it in when? Never! January of never!" Eva hurled back. "The way your ass is set up, you could never model... You wanna work for plus size? Stop. I don't know where you're getting these plus-size fashions from."</p><p>"Your mother," Marlo replied. Everyone stopped dead in their tracks, including the poor tour guide.</p><p>"Don't do that," Eva said sternly, walking over to where Marlo was sitting. "Marlo, I am so sincere. Don't do that." (She later told Bravo cams she was willing to "meet her on the block.")</p><p>This went on for over an hour. Eva eventually roasted Marlo down to her core, even telling her to pick up her "got2b glue" and tack her lace front back down. (Dead.)</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:84c0d56f-aa1e-5a3a-9f71-21aee06e517f data-container-ref=toofab:article:eea3b476-310a-542d-91d0-7ef321158e2d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/72/5by4/2019/01/12/72ad1e3c935e58fabca39f439979d2fb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'RHOA' Fight of the Night: NeNe and Porsha Voice Frustrations with Their Men</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Go take your cigarette break!" Marlo shouted. "You can't even breastfeed 'cause you too busy smoking a cigarette. Breastfeed. Breastfeed. Breastfeed. Can you breastfeed?"</p><p>"Have a child!" Eva countered. "You so bitter, imma pray for you."</p><p>She continued, "What we gon' do is leave my fashions alone," but Marlo interrupted, "What you gon' do is respect your elders! You a child!"</p><p>"I have two kids and a husband. What do you have?" Eva asked.</p><p>"You got two kids by two different men!" Marlo retaliated.</p><p>"And you have what? You have nothing. You have what's on your wrist and that ill-fitting wig you wearing. That's about what we got, so sit it back," Eva urged.</p><p>"The Real Housewives of Atlanta" airs Sundays at 8 p.m. on Bravo.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
