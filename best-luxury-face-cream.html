Skin care makes a lot of tempting promises—take 10 years off your eyes in six weeks! diminished fine lines after just one use! shrink your pores for good!—and they hook us every time. We buy serum after moisturizer after mask in the hope that this one will be the one, but unless you're being monitored in a clinical trial, pinpointing if, and how, a product is working is a lot trickier than deciding it's not (it breaks you out, makes your skin red, doesn't fix dry patches)."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We buy serum after moisturizer after mask in the hope that this one will be the one, but unless you're being monitored in a clinical trial, pinpointing if, and how, a product is working is a lot trickier than deciding it's not (it breaks you out, makes your skin red, doesn't fix dry patches).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But what if I tell you there's a cream that makes just about every claim a cream can make—anti-aging, firming, lifting, moisturizing, repairing, toning and brightening—and not only does it deliver on all of them, it does it in days? It's called Super Cream and it noticeably transforms your skin's texture and tone over the course of a weekend. At nearly $900, it doesn't come cheap, but ask yourself, would you trust it if it did?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here's why it works: While products across mass and prestige brands use many of the same big name active ingredients, most don't include them in truly efficacious levels for short-term results—or have the delivery system that's going to drive them beyond the surface layer of the skin and deep into the cells. "It's impossible to do those things if you're only willing to spend $3 on a product you want to retail for $75," says Julio Lamberty, the VP of R&D at Englewood Lab, where 3LAB is formulated. "But 3LAB doesn't take cost into account during production, which is why it includes 16 active ingredients all at their most effective levels, whereas other companies use one or two, sometimes three or four." Including 16 actives (Pantothenic Acid-Heptapeptide-Cu, a peptide which stimulates collagen and elastin production, and rare Swiss apple stem cells are just two of the stars) that all work synergistically is costly, and it's why other bigger and much more profitable skin care companies have individual product lines to target each claim separately, but at $3,000 per gram, the most expensive aspect of the Super Cream is the exclusive smart-technology delivery system, which is behind the almost-overnight results you see. First developed in the medical pharma field to quickly deliver potent drugs to cancer cells, the X-50 system works like a GPS: "You encapsulate your active ingredient in it and by modifying the surface, you can get into any cell you want. If you know you want to get into the mitochondria and send ATP for recovery, you can," explains Lamberty. "The delivery system has proven effective at doubling the amount of collagen production and booting elastin production in the cells by nine times in just six days."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Having used the Super Cream on and off (more off than on, unfortunately) for two years, I can attest to its superpowers. I notice a difference in my skin's texture overnight: After washing my face in the morning, my bare skin feels like it has a silky smoothing primer on top and my cheeks are just the right amount of rosily flushed that I could skip blush; it's like a real-life Instagram filter. For the most part, I have clear skin, but I'm prone to a flare-up every six weeks or so that dermatologists tell me is due to New York City's pollution. When I'm using the Super Cream, those don't happen—ever. And after stressful weeks and late nights out, it's the only thing that not only instantly brightens my dark circles as well as concealer, but gets rid of them for good in a couple days. The catch, of course, is that the magic spell gradually wears off once you finish the jar. You'll experience feelings of profound loss followed by a return to ordinary skin before you convince yourself you must invest in another. In short: You can put a price on seriously perfect skin—and it's worth every penny.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>3LAB</strong> Super Cream, $875, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.barneys.com/3LAB-Super-Cream/00505023036611,default,pd.html?gclid=COzEqOvkxcECFUsV7AodP1EAqw" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=barneys.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">barneys.com</a>.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/fae6c85d-bef8-475b-bd8c-518bcb0d820c.jpg alt="Headshot of Alexandra Tunell" title="Headshot of Alexandra Tunell" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Alexandra Tunell is the Senior Digital Beauty Editor at Harper's BAZAAR, where she writes beauty features and covers industry news, health, fitness and wellness trends.
