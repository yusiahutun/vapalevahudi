But in the weeks leading up to the Paris couture shows in July, everyone from Halle Berry to Kate Hudson turned to Tamara Ralph for a gala gown. Queen Rania of Jordan wore a sorbet-yellow dress by the Australian couturière to King Charles’ coronation. Lily James channelled Odette/Odile in Swan Lake by appearing first in snowy, pearl-encrusted silk at the Baftas and then in wicked black leather at the Met Ball – both straight from Ralph’s London atelier.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Was the designer surprised by the A-list clamour for her creations? Not in the slightest. "I think they were just saying, 'Thank gosh you’re back!'," she says with a smile. While Tamara Ralph Couture is brand-new, she has been supplying the world’s richest and most beautiful women with fairy-tale gowns for almost 20 years.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Ralph & Russo Paris Haute Couture SS 2020" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/vlcsnap-2020-01-21-09h17m26s931-1579594675.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ralph’s couture atelier is in Millbank, near the Thames in London, but she lives with her partner Bhanu Choudhrie, an Indian-born billionaire, and their two-year-old daughter, Haliya, in Monaco. The couple met at an event in Bordeaux, organised by the Young Presidents’ Organisation, which arranges networking opportunities for top executives and entrepreneurs. They aren’t married yet, partly because Ralph would have to design her own wedding dress and she’s too busy with her new label’s first couture show to dream up a bridal extravaganza for herself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The nature of her work means she spends her time between Monte Carlo and London, and Haliya travels with her. Today, however, Ralph is drinking tea in a central-London hotel, wearing an impeccable draped cream crêpe de chine on top of her own design, and a pair of matching Valentino trousers, her fiancé and daughter ensconced in a suite upstairs. It all seems too good to be true, but the dramas and difficulties of the past few years have taken a toll on Ralph. "If it wasn’t for my baby," she says, "I’m not sure I would have found the strength to begin again."</p><img alt="tamara ralph, hb sept 2023" title="Tamara Ralph, HB Sept 2023" width=667 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fairer-23-06-28-harpers-bazaar-uk-tamara-ralph-0750-preview-6503279c7944b.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Robert Fairer</span><p>Details from Tamara Ralph’s new atelier</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Behind today’s success lies a cautionary tale. In 2017, Ralph was riding high as one half of the couture house Ralph & Russo with her then partner, Michael Russo. They had been named in Fortune’s annual list of the 40 most successful people under 40 – the only representatives of the fashion world to get the nod. Theirs was the sole British house that the extremely picky Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture allowed to show as part of the official schedule during couture fashion weeks. And then the label became a household name when Meghan Markle chose a Ralph & Russo look for her official engagement pictures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That dress created quite a rumpus – it was the wrong colour! It had a see-through top! It cost $75,000! – and Ralph says now that she thought "it was an interesting choice. It was quite a statement gown because it was black and potentially revealing and quite progressive". Whatever traditionalists might have made of it, the design was a social-media hit.</p><img alt="meghan markle and prince harry engagement photos" title="Prince Harry Meghan Markle engagement photos" width=768 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-meghan-markle-photo-1513861672.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Alexi Lubomirski</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Meghan Markle wearing Ralph & Russo to announce her engagement to Prince Harry</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And then the fantasy began to unravel: the couple broke up and shortly afterwards, the pandemic hit and the bottom fell out of the couture market. Worse was to follow when the company went into administration amid claims of excessive spending, huge debts and alleged mismanagement of the business.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ralph, who by this point was pregnant with her daughter, was devastated. She still finds talking about the bad times a challenge – when the subject comes up, her lip trembles and her sunny expression darkens. "I put my heart and soul into it," she says. "And what happened with the brand was incredibly traumatic. It was so heartbreaking for me – and what made it harder is that it was all happening at the same time I was giving birth."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I wasn’t prepared for the emotions"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img alt="london, england december 02 tamara ralph and olivia culpo arrive at the fashion awards 2019 held at royal albert hall on december 02, 2019 in london, england photo by jeff spicerbfcgetty images" title="The Fashion Awards 2019 - Red Carpet Arrivals" width=3156 height=4332 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1191540290-650328d100e44.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeff Spicer/BFC</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Tamara Ralph at the Fashion Awards in 2019, with Olivia Culpo</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She was trying to enjoy "the happiest moment of my life" while also going through "the most painful experience". Not surprising, perhaps, that she suffered from postnatal depression. "Being a new mother is hard enough, and having all that [stress about the business]… it impacted me a lot," she admits. "Women struggle even if they don’t have such a difficult situation. I wasn’t prepared for the emotions."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What Ralph found the most difficult was worrying about what would happen to her team of seamstresses and craftspeople. "I had worked with these people for most of my career," she explains. "And I considered them to be my family." It surely speaks for itself that everyone she recruited for her new label, Tamara Ralph Couture, was once a Ralph & Russo employee. "They believe in me," she says. "They believe in my creativity and we’re all very happy to be working together again.’</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Not that Ralph thought she would be back at the couture shows a mere two years after her business imploded. "I wanted to take some time to enjoy my baby," she says. But her regular customers wouldn’t hear of it. "I had clients calling me up, saying 'Darling, I’ve nothing to wear.'" Another rang the new mother to say, "You’ve had your baby, so let’s start creating again".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sooner or later, though, Ralph was always going to dive back into the world of fashion. It has been part of her life since her earliest childhood, and she is the fourth generation of her family to be in the design business. Her great-grandmother was a dressmaker, her grandmother was a couturière and her mother studied fashion before becoming an interior designer (she also made all of Ralph’s clothes herself). As a child, Ralph was fascinated by the sewing room of their house in Sydney. She would wait until her mother had left the house "and then I would take down her dress patterns and cut them up and create something new, which would upset her greatly," she remembers. "I started when I was around eight or nine, and when I was a young teenager I was allowed near the sewing machine." Ralph would take her designs to her grandmother at weekends and the older woman would critique them. "She would rip them apart and look inside and tell me everything that was wrong." There’s probably no better way to learn about craftsmanship and perfectionism.</p><img alt="tamara ralph, hb sept 2023" title="Backstage at the ﻿Ralph & ﻿Russo ﻿Haute Couture Spring Summer 2020 show" width=3861 height=2574 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ralph-e-russo-hc-bbt-s20-007-65032a56cf635.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Matteo Scarpellini</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">LAUNCHMETRICS SPOTLIGHT</span><p>Backstage at the Ralph & Russo Haute Couture Spring Summer 2020 show</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">By the time she was 12, Ralph was wearing her own outfit to the graduation ceremony from her primary school – black and covered with appliqué stars that she had stitched on by hand. Later, as a student at the Whitehouse Institute of Design, Australia’s equivalent of Central Saint Martins, she was always interested in the more expensive and exclusive end of fashion. Despite her tutors’ attempts to teach Ralph the benefits of utilitarian design, she never compromised and stuck to her own, glamorous, vision.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Sydney in the early 2000s was "a much more casual society," recalls Ralph. "There weren’t many luxury stores at all." With no home market for her couture ambitions, she knew she had to move to Europe to do what she loved. So, aged 23, she found herself in London, where she had a stylist friend who took her under her wing. "I came over with a dream and a hope. It was a humble beginning but I worked really hard."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"If it wasn’t for my baby, I’m not sure I would have found the strength to begin again"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Essentially, Ralph’s entrepreneurial career began with her wearing her own designs to events and attracting the attention of other guests who would go on to become clients and, eventually, friends. One early customer, attracted by her black double-satin slinky evening gown embellished with hand-embroidered crystals, ordered six pieces from her on the spot and word spread. In 2006, she registered her company with Russo, having met the Australian banker on a street corner in London and fallen into love and a business partnership with him. (This used to be known as "fashion’s favourite fairy tale" before the dream shattered.) In 2014, she was at an event in Baku with her friend and client Zaha Hadid, when she was called and invited to show on schedule during Paris Couture.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These days, most of her customers are from the Middle East and Europe, though Chinese and Indian socialites are also queueing up for dresses that take up to six months and untold thousands to make. Many of them have been customers for years. "The thing about what I do," explains Ralph, "is that you’re involved in a lot of special moments. It could be a wedding, and that’s a happy and emotional time. Or it could be a suit someone wears to receive a damehood." (As it was in the case of Angelina Jolie.)</p><img alt="us actress angelina jolie r is presented with the insignia of an honorary dame grand cross of the most distinguished order of st michael and st george by britain's queen elizabeth ii in the 1844 room at buckingham palace in central london, on october 10, 2014 angelina jolie was awarded an honorary damehood dcmg for services to uk foreign policy and the campaign to end war zone sexual violence afp photoanthony devlinpool photo credit should read anthony devlinafp via getty images" title="BRITAIN-ROYALS-ANGELINA JOLIE" width=2440 height=3499 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-456988074-65032dca89010.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Anthony Devlin</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Angelina Jolie wearing Ralph & Russo to receive her damehood in 2014</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ralph’s special skill, she believes, is that "when I meet someone, I know exactly what they should wear. Designing bespoke is about enhancing everything they would want to enhance. That’s the beauty of couture." There’s also the matter of concealing anything they might want to hide, which is why couture appointments can be "very intimate. And you end up building a close bond." The slow-fashion couture process means she will meet a client, speak to them "and get a feel for who they are". She could be called upon to provide not just one special outfit, but a whole wardrobe of clothes that will last a customer through an entire season of dinners, yacht cruises, balls and parties. Jolie was a particular inspiration, says Russo. "I did quite a lot of work for her throughout the years – I enjoy working with her because she’s creative herself and she loves the whole process. She knows herself really well and she feeds in."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s surely only a matter of time before Jolie strikes a pose in a Tamara Ralph creation. But she will see a difference, for Ralph believes her designs have changed since she launched her new label. "I have always been a designer who celebrates femininity," she explains. "But I’ve grown stronger through my experiences, and I think that shows in the clothing. There’s a strength behind the pieces now – they almost have an armour built in. A lot of beautiful metalwork." She adds that her new designs are "a little bit more modern, grown-up and slightly cleaner".</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I’ve grown stronger through my experiences, and I think that shows in the clothing"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The maison itself is also stronger and simpler. "We’re all much wiser," she says of herself and the staff with whom she is now reunited. "The team is smaller and I’ve learnt lessons about how to structure things differently".</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The label’s first couture show, held in July in the gilt-and-white Grand Salon of Paris’ Shangri-La hotel, demonstrated a different kind of structure. Of course, there were silken roses and mint-green ostrich-feather capes, but there were also pearl-encrusted wire corsets, metallic floral breastplates and a dress made of chainmail. It was a display of Ralph’s characteristic femininity and also a testament to her new strength. Haliya was backstage all day and, when her mother emerged at the end, she brought the child onto the catwalk with her to take her bow as well. "It’s only fair," Ralph tells me afterwards. "She really inspired me. You want your children to be proud of you and that’s my motivation". A pause, and a smile. "After all, I couldn’t have done it without her."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1samtpbX5xe9OapJqqkWK%2ForjPoWSipqSav7e1xLBm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lenco-ls-50led-bk-turntable-review.html><span>←</span><span>Belt-Driven Turntable Is Your First Step Into Vinyl</span></a>
