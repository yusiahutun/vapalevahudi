What is the icon’s story?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Richard_Chamberlain></span>Who Is Richard Chamberlain?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>George Richard Chamberlain is a famous American actor and singer. He was born on March 31, 1934, in Beverly Hills, California, to parents Elsa Winnifred, an actress and singer, and Charles Axion Chamberlain, a salesman who reportedly battled alcoholism. He grew up in Beverly Hills with his older brother, Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>Chamberlain graduated from Beverly Hills High School and attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, in 1956. While in Ponoma College, he studied painting and art history and got involved in student dramatic productions, which is how his love for acting began.&nbsp;</p><p>In his 2003 memoir “Shattered Love,” Chamberlain wrote that he had “a life-changing breakthrough” after performing in George Bernard Shaw’s “Arms and the Man.” He had an epiphany and decided to embrace his “first love” and pursue acting fully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before Chamberlain could take up acting full-time, he was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War forcing him to pause his acting dreams. He attained the rank of sergeant while serving in Korea from 1956–58, but the “Petulia” actor has recounted not liking his experience.&nbsp;</p><p>In an interview with The Advocate, he said, “I hated being in the Army. . . . I don’t like being ordered around, and I don’t like ordering people around. I came out a sergeant. It was all just another role for me.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Richard_Chamberlains_Career></span>Richard Chamberlain’s Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After returning from the army, Chamberlain went back to his acting career. He co-founded a Los Angeles–based theatre group, “Company of Angels,” and began appearing on television in guest roles in the early 1960s. His acting breakthrough role was as a young intern, Dr. James Kildare. His kind, caring physician role made him a household name, winning him a Golden Globe Award in 1963.</p><p>Chamberlain’s leading-man good looks also opened the door to other parts, giving him a lead role in most of the projects he worked on, such as the 1963 dramatic film “Twilight of Honor.”&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after Dr. Kildare ended in 1966, he moved to England, where he delved into theatrical work. He played in repertory theatre and the BBC’s “Portrait of a Lady” adaptation, becoming recognized as a serious actor.&nbsp;</p><p>Still riding on his wave of success, Chamberlain again won over viewers with his next big TV project, the 1980 miniseries “The Thorn Birds.” He played the controversial role of a&nbsp; priest who struggled to keep his vows because of his love and attraction to a young woman.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Thorn Birds” also earned numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe win and an Emmy Award nomination for Chamberlain. He later played Jason Bourne in the 1988 TV adaptation of Robert Ludlum’s “The Bourne Identity’.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Richard_Chamberlains_Movies_and_TV_Shows></span>Richard Chamberlain’s Movies and TV Shows<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chamberlain’s career spans over 50 years, and has been in many highly successful movies and TV shows. Here are a couple of his <a href=#>films</a>:</p><ul><li>The Secret of the Purple Reef – 1960</li><li>A Thunder of Drums – 1961</li><li>Twilight of Honor – 1963</li><li>Joy in the Morning – 1965</li><li>Petulia – 1968</li><li>Julius Caesar – 1970</li><li>The Three Musketeers – 1973</li><li>The Four Musketeers – 1974</li><li>We Are the Hartmans – 2011</li><li><a href=#>Justice League</a>: Gods and Monsters – 2015</li></ul><p>Some of his successful TV shows are:</p><ul><li>The Woman I Love- 1972</li><li>The Thorn Birds- 1983</li><li>The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years- 1996</li><li>Blackbeard- 2006</li><li>Chuck– 2010</li></ul><p>Chamberlain also made a couple of successful soundtracks for a couple of movies, including “Three Stars Will Shine Tonight” (1962), “Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo” (1963), and “Blue Guitar/They Long to Be Close to You” (1963).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Richard_Chamberlain_Gay></span>Is Richard Chamberlain Gay?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, the “Murder By Phone” actor is gay. He was not open about his homosexuality for most of his career to protect his privacy and acting opportunities. Still, he was outed by the French women’s magazine Nous Deux in December 1989.&nbsp;</p><p>Chamberlain was involved romantically with fellow actor Wesley Eure in the early 1970s. In 1977, Chamberlain began a long-term relationship with another actor Martin Rabbett.&nbsp;</p><p>Rabbett played the brother of Chamberlain’s lead character in the 1986 film “Allan Quatermain” and the “Lost City of Gold.” They began living together in Hawaii in 1986 and had a private commitment ceremony — the two split in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>In his 2003 autobiography, “Shattered Love,” Chamberlain went public with his sexual orientation. He finally felt unafraid to tell his truth, saying in a 2003 Dateline interview, “I’m not a romantic leading man anymore, so I don’t need to nurture that public image anymore.”</p><p>Chamberlain remains an active actor and has remained relevant for over 50 years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kv6qvx5qpnWWTna6ursSro5qhnmK6prHTZquhnV1rfbR5x56Yq6yknb%2Bwro4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jeanette-adair-bradshaw-all-about-morgan-freemans-first-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Jeanette Adair Bradshaw: All About Morgan Freemans First Wife</span></a>
