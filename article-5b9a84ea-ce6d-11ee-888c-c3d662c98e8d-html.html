His wife and family were everything to him. He was madly in love with Judy and always made the very most out of every moment they shared together. He always loved spending time and vacationing with Judy and his brother Billy and sister-in-law Vederia. He had a great love for music. He loved to sing and play guitar, but he loved hearing his granddaughter Gracee sing the most. His songbird.&nbsp;</p><p>He worked in newspaper advertising at Mississippi Press for years and then retired as publisher at the Laurel Leader-Call. He had many lifelong friends through work and church.&nbsp;</p><p>A memorial service to honor his life will be at Memory Chapel Funeral Home in Laurel on Monday, Feb. 19, at 11 a.m. Visitation will begin at 10 a.m. He will be laid to rest at Shady Grove Baptist Church in Laurel. We know he is now rejoicing in Heaven with his loved ones that have gone before him.&nbsp;</p><p>To sign the online guestbook, visit <a href=#><span>www.memorychapellaurel.com</span></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnlJa%2Fs7HLpWSrmalixKK4yp6paJmiqbakuMSYbJtxkW2Bpq2MnJxvnF1mfqaxjHFvcZtdmIClgpVrmnJwlW2xb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./657cae1a22601d32748b45ee-html.html><span>←</span><span>Vikings vs Bengals: dnde ver en vivo, hora, canal y pronstico NFL 2023</span></a>
