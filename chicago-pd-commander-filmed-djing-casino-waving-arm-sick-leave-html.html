Chicago PD told DailyMail.com that Carter wasn't paid for her appearance, and that she received permission to appear - but the party has nonetheless generated controversy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The incident was publicized by Paul Vallas, a <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-a9e96860-9a75-11ec-971c-45a078bd9fb6>Democrat</a>&nbsp;running for mayor.

It is unclear what the outcome was, but a CPD spokesman told DailyMail.com that Carter had not done anything wrong, suggesting that she'd been cleared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Facebook post</a> last month, Vallas criticized Carter for 'moonlighting' as a DJ and 'holding her hand in the air.' He called it an example of the police department 'promoting unqualified and undeserving personnel into positions of leadership and affording them preferential treatment.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Carter is the wife of Chicago PD First Deputy Superintendent Eric Carter, who is the second most powerful police officer in the Windy City.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The cop also shared a <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-c84f0b60-b626-11ee-b310-29306ae54936>Facebook</a> photo of herself raising her arm and DJing in December, although
