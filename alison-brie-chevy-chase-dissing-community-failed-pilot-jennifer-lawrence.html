Brie spoke with <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> on <a href=#><strong>WWHL</strong></a> about Chase's take on the series</p><p>She also opened up about working with a then-unknown <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a> on a pilot that was never picked up -- but we absolutely must demand gets released -- and how brutally she once rejected someone with a single emoji.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:ab629760-4baa-4cb3-ad03-c3daf21fb476 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2bdeb226-6387-4e9f-b6f8-67c08d065f71 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a5/5by4/2023/11/28/a525bc04548842008b0faa015078b572_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jennifer Lawrence Addresses Plastic Surgery Rumors, Talks Aging in Hollywood</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>That came up when Andy asked her if she'd ever been ghosted by someone famous, and she said she's more likely to be the one doing the ghosting. Then she shared that she once declined a date offer from someone with the "thumbs down" emoji.</p><p>As Andy's jaw dropped and the audience gasped at the harsh measure, Alison assured everyone that the unnamed guy "deserved it."</p><p>Later, she talked about a surprising star-crossed encounter she didn't even realize at first she'd had, and it all stems back to a failed Comedy Central pilot she says was called Not Another High School Show.</p><p>A parody of the 2000s-era glut of high school shows, and obviously similar to the Not Another (insert overplayed genre here) Movie films, Alison said she played a character called Muffy the Vampire Slayer, joking that she went "method" for the role.</p><p>She recalled that long before she was tripping up Oscars stages, Jennifer Lawrence had one line in the pilot. It wasn't until years later when she saw J-Law's career taking off that she even realized it was the same young girl from the failed pilot</p><p>...</p><p>which means that Comedy Central (or someone) is sitting on a gold mine video.</p><p>We need a special screening of Not Another High School Show and we need it stat! Do it as a benefit to raise money for school systems ... just make sure this happens. Some gems should not be left in the vault!</p><h3 class=h3>Chevy Chase's Community Crack</h3><p>While hanging with Rebel Wilson, and <a href=#><strong>fangirling over her vacation</strong></a> with Barbra Streisand and their mutual "billionaire" friends, Brie also talked about hearing Chevy Chase's hot take on the modern classic NBC sitcom as it happened.</p><p>"You know, that happened on <a href=#><strong>Marc Maron's</strong></a> podcast, who I worked with on Glow," she told Andy. "I always listen, so I really, like, heard it live before I read it online."</p><p>"I actually think that was the better way to digest that information because I could hear Chevy's tone," she continued. "I feel like I knew him well. When you read it in a headline, it reads much harsher."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b004e4f1-71c5-4913-b0c3-ae7bfec0b2e5 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2bdeb226-6387-4e9f-b6f8-67c08d065f71 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/67/5by4/2023/09/26/679c0b083ff54a62b66631510aecffdb_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett Collection</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Chevy Chase Dumps on Community Cast, Says 'Show Wasn't Funny Enough for Me'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I was kind of like, 'Oh, it's just Chevy being Chevy and he's entitled to his opinions of his experience of the show,'" she laughed. "I don't take it personally."</p><p>While appearing on the <a href=#><strong>WTF with Marc Maron</strong></a> podcast back in September, Chase did <a href=#><strong>not speak particularly well</strong></a> of the show or his time on it. The <a href=#><strong>Saturday Night Live</strong></a> legend was a part of the main cast the first four seasons and a guest for Season 5.</p><p>"I honestly felt the show wasn't funny enough for me, ultimately. I felt a little bit constrained," Chase told Maron. "Everybody had their bits, and I thought they were all good. It just wasn't hard hitting enough for me."</p><p>Community has been praised by fans and critics for many years now for breaking down the expectations of the sitcom format, pushing new boundaries, and satirizing pretty much everything, while staying true to its characters' emotional beats and growth.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:51e43d07-9a81-451f-ae9d-6981d7b69588 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2bdeb226-6387-4e9f-b6f8-67c08d065f71 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a8/5by4/2024/03/11/a830a666c1714176afc91b9b581ca892_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / TooFab</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Joel McHale Reveals When We Can Expect The 'Community' Movie (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I just felt that it was… I felt happier being alone," Chase said. "I just didn't want to be surrounded by that table, every day, with those people. It was too much."</p><p>Chase and Community parted ways when he was fired in 2012 for using the n-word in front of co-stars <a href=#><strong>Yvette Nicole Brown</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Donald Glover</strong></a>, per <a href=#><strong>TVLine</strong></a>, while getting into it with creator <a href=#><strong>Dan Harmon</strong></a> (the use of the word was not directed at anyone).</p><p>On <a href=#><strong>CBS Sunday Morning</strong></a> in 2022, Chase was asked about accusations that he was unpleasant -- or worse -- to work with both on Saturday Night Live and Community. "I guess you'd have to ask them. I don't give a crap," Chase said of his former colleagues.</p><p>"I am who I am. And I like who I am. I don't care. And it's part of me that I don't care," he continued. "And I've thought about that a lot. And I don't know what to tell you, man. I just don't care."</p><a id=gallery-link-ca2302bd-739c-4c66-b023-99df4519da20 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:ca2302bd-739c-4c66-b023-99df4519da20 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:2bdeb226-6387-4e9f-b6f8-67c08d065f71 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5f/4by3/2024/04/08/5f4de120fe8a414c8a5dc9a5efb5dc58_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maXFflrmqv86nZJuqmZp6pLTEr7Bmm5iWwKZ5w6KqrKGenHqku8ymrKehpK56p63IpZydZaCeubDAjKOcp6aZm7KzecuarqudnpiycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./parody-cryptocurrency-just-broke-us2-billion-its-market-cap.html><span>←</span><span>Wow much coin: A parody cryptocurrency just broke US$2 billion for its market cap</span></a>
