"So grateful to have found this and have it closed, and so grateful for my amazing doctors. A year later I'm feeling strong and healthy."</p><p>Back in March 2022, the wife of <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> revealed she had been hospitalized after experiencing stroke-like symptoms when a blood clot traveled to her brain. She later shared that it was categorized as a Transient Ischemic Attack.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:46bbc255-772c-4243-b70b-b9c551c73bad data-container-ref=toofab:article:9fd6540e-a875-4e0a-941b-811270e85dd2 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/09/5by4/2023/04/20/0913f74dbcbd4535a2cbde8037751aa6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Hailey Bieber Says She's 'Fragile' After 'Saddest, Hardest' Moments in 'My Adult Life'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>After a few more tests, Hailey's team of medical professionals discovered that the blood clot had made its way from her heart to her brain through a patent foramen ovale -- meaning the model had a flaplike hole in her heart that never fully closed after birth.</p><p>At the time, Bieber shared how the procedure went in a video posted to YouTube. &nbsp;"It went very smoothly. I'm recovering really well, really fast. I feel great," she explained. "This biggest thing I feel, honestly, I just feel really relieved that we were able to figure everything out, that we were able to get it closed, that I will be able to just move on from this really scary situation and just live my life."</p><p>Earlier this year, Bieber opened up about how the traumatic incident affected her mental health.</p><p>While appearing on an episode of the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Run-Through with Vogue</a>" podcast in January, she shared that she has experienced anxiety as well as PTSD after she was hospitalized following her mini-stroke.</p><p>"It was very difficult," Hailey said. "I struggled with a lot of anxiety after. I struggled with a little bit of PTSD of just, like, the fear of maybe it was gonna happen again. It was just a feeling that I was, like, I never want to experience that ever again. I mean, it was so terrifying, so jarring, so discombobulating in every single way that you could imagine."</p><p>Reflecting on the health scare, she continued, "It was something that was completely unexpected. You know, when you're 25 and you're young, you believe you're really healthy, and you know, do things to maintain your health."</p><p>"All the doctors kept saying it was just kind of a perfect storm," Bieber added. "It was a couple different factors that led to you having a small blood clot, and the blood clot traveled through the hole in my heart up to the brain, which is why I had, you know, what they call a mini-stroke."</p><p>"It was definitely the scariest thing I've ever gone through," she said.</p><a id=gallery-link-70cbf79d-ac68-4210-b198-ef0028245e7e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:70cbf79d-ac68-4210-b198-ef0028245e7e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:9fd6540e-a875-4e0a-941b-811270e85dd2 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fc/4by3/2023/04/25/fccfe76e21104ccba1960884d74097d4_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21ma21fna6quMSyZJuhlZeys3nMmqmkq12ku6Z52J6Yq2WjnruksYyupZ2dopy8qrrGZp%2BemaKperTB0aCcq7FdlrO1sdFmpKKmmWLAtb7OpJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dozens-taken-to-the-hospital-following-kenny-chesney-concert.html><span>←</span><span>Dozens Taken To The Hospital Following Kenny Chesney Concert</span></a>
