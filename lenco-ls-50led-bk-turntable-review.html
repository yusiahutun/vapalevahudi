Buying a new turntable, new speakers, an amp, and other hardware become a significant and off-putting initial outlay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lenco's LS-50LED BK offers a handy alternative to that outlay, a decent turntable with two integrated speakers, RCA line output, and an additional USB output you can use to digitize your vinyl collection. And with integrated LED lighting and a stylish design, the LS-50LED BK brings a tidy and budget-minded audio package to the table.</p><p>But how does it stack up? Is the Lenco LS-50LED BK turntable worth using?</p><h2 id=lenco-ls-50led-bk-features-integrated-lights-and-stylish-design>Lenco LS-50LED BK Features Integrated Lights and Stylish Design</h2><p>Let's start from the top. First, the Lenco LS-50LED BK looks pretty good. It's not a mind-blowing, unique bit of engineering, but it's stylish enough that you'll keep the Lenco LS-50LED BK on display as part of your audio setup. The base of the unit is solid and wooden, comes with a brushed metal effect, and is supported by four rounded feet at each corner—two of which contain integrated speakers, but more on these in a moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/lenco-ls-50led-turntable-rca-inputs.jpg><p>The turntable case has a slight blue-ish tinge and features the Lenco logo in the center. As you'd expect, it's constructed from a robust plastic that should withstand some bumps and scratches, but that's not something I set out to test specifically. And, as you shouldn't really use your turntable as a replacement for storage, I didn't go about trying to pile it high with heavy objects to test how sturdy it is. What is for sure is that the LS-50LED BK case will protect the turntable against accidental damage and also allows the turntable's integrated LED lighting to shine through.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On that, yes, one of the biggest differences between the LS-50LED BK and the original LS-50 is the addition of LED lighting around the turntable platter, shining through when you play a record. If RGB is your thing and you'd like a little more flair from your standard turntable, the LS-50LED BK is a good option. However, I have to say the LED array is somewhat limited. We're not talking Razer Chroma's 16.8 million color selection here. You can use the buttons on the turntable unit to switch between the single color mode, the fading LED mode, or an animated LED mode that reacts to your music.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Of the three, the LED fading mode works best, gently oscillating between the LED colors. The audio response mode is okay, but it's a little jumpy, and the color transitions don't always work well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lenco-ls-50led-bk-turntable-features>Lenco LS-50LED BK Turntable Features</h2><p>Now, aside from the Lenco LS-50LED BK's integrated LED lighting, you'll want to know about its other features.</p><p>The turntable features the three standard speeds, 33, 45, and 78, which you can adjust using a small switch found alongside the tonearm holder. Each speed works as it should, and while the small switch feels basic, as you won't be adjusting it heaps and can be gentle when switching, it should last for a long time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>One nice touch for the LS-50LED BK is the adjustable tonearm weight, something you don't always see, but Lenco takes its turntables seriously across its entire range. You'll find the adjustment weight underneath the top of the arm. Similarly, the presence of a cueing lever is another handy feature that helps you to place the stylus gently, protecting your vinyl from damage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's a semi-automatic, belt-driven turntable. When you move the arm, the platter begins moving almost immediately and similarly stops when you lift it from the vinyl. The belt-driven platter is nice and smooth and remains at tempo without falter.</p><h2 id=how-does-the-lenco-ls-50led-bk-sound>How Does the Lenco LS-50LED BK Sound?</h2><p>You have two options for sound: the integrated stereo speakers found in the feet of the unit, or the RCA output, which allows you to connect the turntable to external speakers.</p><p>Lenco's integrated speakers are okay in a pinch. If you don't have any other speaker options available to connect to, the LS-50LED BK's integrated speakers will do. They get plenty loud courtesy of the turntable's built-in amp, which is a good thing, but they're not going to deliver your audio with crystal clarity or mindblowing frequency response.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The integrated speakers handle top-end best, offering clarity in parts. However, when it comes to mid-range, things begin to get a bit muddy, with vocals and instruments tending to blend into one another, and tracks depending on bass sound lackluster. It's not outright terrible, and if you don't have any other speakers, these will do. However, you're unlikely to ditch your external speakers and replace them with the LS-50LED BK's integrated speakers.</p><p>Outputting the LS-50LED BK to a separate set of speakers is the best option for audio quality. Connecting them to a separate set of speakers gives you the full range of whatever external audio hardware you have (presuming it is of decent quality). Even connecting them up to my desktop speakers—a Logitech Z623 set that is hardly "audiophile quality"—the difference is night and day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Note that while the LS-50LED BK does have an amp, you'll want a set of active speakers to output to, unless you're outputting to a separate amp first.</p><h2 id=digitize-your-vinyl-with-the-lenco-ls-50led-bk>Digitize Your Vinyl With the Lenco LS-50LED BK</h2><p>Something that sets the LS-50LED BK apart from other turntables at this price point is the integrated USB port out that allows you to digitize your record collection.</p><p>You can connect the LS-50LED BK to another device, hit play on the record player, and record the audio output. Lenco's manual gives instructions for the free and open-source audio suite, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Audacity</a>, though <a href=#>other audio-recording software</a> will also do the job. As you'll find out, the problem with writing and printing instructions in a manual is that those instructions might not be accurate for very long. Furthermore, the inputs and outputs specific to your computer will differ. The below image details the settings I used to connect the LS-50LED BK to Audacity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Your mileage may vary, but you're typically looking to connect your internal soundcard with the USB recording device, from where you capture the turntable's audio output.</p><p>Once connected, the recording process is simple, although the output quality varies massively depending on your vinyl. Older vinyl typically carries the most imperfections in its grooves, which translates to your recordings. Newer pressings suffer less from these issues, but honestly, you're always going to struggle to get an exact, like-for-like digitized version of your favorite vinyl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That's not to say the feature isn't worth using. Even with Audacity's out-of-the-box tools, you can clear up the recordings, remove noise, and reduce some interference. If you have specific recordings you want to create a digital version of, this is a handy option. Just don't expect studio quality.</p><h2 id=the-lenco-ls-50led-bk-is-a-tidy-entry-level-turntable>The Lenco LS-50LED BK Is a Tidy, Entry-Level Turntable</h2><p>The LS-50LED BK comes in at around $190, which is pretty decent for an entry-level turntable. And no, when we talk "entry-level" turntable, we're not talking about things like the Crosley Cruiser, which sounds awful no matter how you listen to it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And therein is one of the biggest differences. While the Lenco LS-50LED BK's integrated speakers may not deliver the audio quality you want, Lenco has been in the turntable and audio hardware game for a long time. Hence, when you connect the LS-50LED BK to some proper speakers, you get a proper audio output worthy of playing your favorite records.</p><p>It has some decent features, too. Multi-speed support, a weighted tonearm, and a tidy aesthetic add up to a neat turntable package that's perfect for someone that wants to listen to vinyl but doesn't want to break the bank to do so.</p><p>Now, the LEDs aren't the best quality, but they do add a nice touch of flair if that's what you're after. However, if it's not, but you like the sound of the LS-50LED BK, you could take a look at its LED-less counterpart, the standard Lenco LS-50, which comes with all the same specs but none of the flash lighting.</p><p>So, no, the LS-50LED BK is unlikely to appeal to audiophiles and those with a serious vinyl habit. However, Lenco has never made any pretenses that it would, and with that in mind, the LS-50LED BK could be your gateway into the world of vinyl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGijnqaTpHqtv4xuZ6WdlGKvrHnTrqmnrJGXuaZ50Z6top2nZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-kendrick-pilgrim-premiere-0810.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Kendrick Red Carpet Picture</span></a>
