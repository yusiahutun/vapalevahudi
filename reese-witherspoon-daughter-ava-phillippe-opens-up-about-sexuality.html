"It's an odd situation because I didn't grow up famous. So [Ava is] living an experience that I did not have, and so are my sons," the actress said.

"Ava is so down-to-earth. She wants to do great things in the world," Witherspoon said. "She's studying and learning and trying to find herself. It's a big thing in life to try different things and figure out what is really your path."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Phillippe recently celebrated her 22nd birthday, in September. Witherspoon shared a loving birthday tribute to her now grown-up daughter on Instagram, featuring a photo of her alongside a sweet note. "Happy Birthday to my sweet little girl…excuse me… I mean my adult daughter!!!" she wrote. "Words can't describe how proud I am of you. You have grown into an extraordinary person who cares so much about the world around her. I am so lucky to have you light up my life.
