Both the Footloose actor and Miss Rose White shared tributes on Instagram which shows not much has changed between the lovebirds in the last three decades after getting married in 1988.</p><p>Kyra shared a snap from their first film together Lemon Sky gushing, “It was 1987- on the set of “Lemon Sky” – I met a man named Kevin. Happy 35 my love.” Kevin chose another adorable picture writing, “35 years feels like a heartbeat.”</p><p><strong>READ</strong>: <a href=#>Famous band frontman has ‘weeks to live’ as he fights on ‘deathbed in hospice’</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kevin-bacon-wasn-t-kyra-s-ideal-type>Kevin Bacon wasn’t Kyra’s “ideal type”</h2><p>Even before meeting on the set of Lemon Sky, Kyra, and Kevin actually first met when the former was only 12 years old. Kyra approached Kevin to pass a compliment on a matinee play that he was acting on after being encouraged by her brother. But it wasn’t until almost a decade later, that Kyra and Kevin got together for their first acting project, Lemon Sky.</p><p>While Kevin asked Kyra out immediately during their time on the Lemon Sky set, The Closer actress shared that The Woodsman actor was not really her type! But soon after, Kyra realized that Kevin was the one as she recalled in an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview</a>, “When I did fall in love with Kevin, it really just felt like there was some urgency to get married, and I don’t know what it was. Suddenly this thing came over me and I was terrified. He was just the one, you know? He was just the soul mate, he was just the one.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dancing-through-life-with-you-to-airing-dirty-laundry>“Dancing through life with you” to “airing dirty laundry”</h2><p>Kevin and Kyra have spent trying times together including a whole quarantine during the pandemic but their playful banter with each other never ends which also involves sharing “dirty laundry” with millions of fans!</p><p>In 2021, Kevin took to Instagram to share a snap of him doing laundry featuring a lacy thong where it was written “I heart emoji KB” with rhinestones. The owner of the thong aka Kyra soon commented on the picture quipping, “Thanks for airing my dirty laundry!”</p><p>Throughout their time together, Kevin and Kyra also made sure to celebrate their wedding milestones with fans, sometimes gifting a duet or sharing a dreamy throwback picture with the caption, “Here’s to dancing through life with you.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2WCcLfEr6CnZZKWsLC60marsKddpbWwwM6sZGxtXa6yor7SZpipmaKperG%2Bzq%2BcZpmSqLytwdOeo7JlnqTBqbXNoGShmaNisKmtzaCcnWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joshua-bassett-church-baptized.html><span>←</span><span>Joshua Bassett Baptized At California Megachurch</span></a>
