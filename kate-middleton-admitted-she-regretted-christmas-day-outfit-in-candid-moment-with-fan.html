The pictures that you see with them when they leave the church are all quite serious, it’s because they’ve got their press face on.</p><p>“Kate was talking to my daughter about clothes and how she was feeling too hot, she said ‘I really shouldn’t have worn this.’ I’m there talking to Charlotte about dolls and my daughter’s talking about fashion with Kate.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Prince William ‘would come home and cry’ at night after his ‘rigorous’ job</a></p><p>She continued: ‘It wasn’t fake it was a genuine discussion, it was about a minute but it was tailored to my daughter, it was like speaking to a friend. They are totally different with the public.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kate-and-her-fashion>Kate and her fashion</h2><p>There are other instances in which Kate Middleton might regret what she was wearing. It was claimed one time <a href=#>she was having a ‘dig’ at her sister-in-law.</a> However, a royal expert was quick to say the idea that she would do that to <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> was “ridiculous.”</p><p>Kate and other female members of the <a href=#>royal</a> family wore similar bright colors to Kate’s Together at Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey. This came after the premiere of <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan documentary Harry & Meghan. In the Netflix limited series, the 42-year-old claimed she would&nbsp;“tone down” what she wore in public appearances and wear colors like white and beige so not as to overshadow her in-laws.</p><p>The former <a href=#>TV</a> actress added: “Until that last week in the UK, I rarely wore color and I never wanted to upstage or ruffle any feathers, so I just tried to blend in.”</p><p>All of the female royals in attendance at the carol service were dressed in burgundy-toned colors, not neutral.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Kate Middleton’s event with Meghan and Harry was ‘hardest thing she’s ever faced’, author says</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2d%2FcLfArZxmpZmZsa2x06ilZpmUora1wMSdZKyglWK%2FprPRnqutnZRisKm%2ByKyrppmjYrGixYyorK2emal6qrqMnJinnJmZeq67zJ6lrWWnnsGpecWapWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./evan-roberts-wife-children-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Evan Roberts Thinks Every Woman Is A Hero For Enduring Child Birth</span></a>
