Despite major advancements in treatment procedures such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy, the breakthroughs have been gradual. Although new technologies have emerged in recent decades, the fundamental challenge of effectively reaching every cancer cell within a tumor persists.&nbsp;</p><p>When tumors grow, their blood vessels become malfunctioning and often collapsed&nbsp; limiting the delivery of drugs and immune cells and create low-oxygen areas where cancer stem cells thrive, thus making cancer treatments less effective. Multiple studies around the globe demonstrated that 90% of the volume of a tumor receives little or no drug at all in systemic treatments. This is where <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Starpax Biopharma</strong></a><strong> </strong>comes in.</p><p>Its innovative technology aims to overcome this challenge by reaching and eliminating cancer cells throughout the entire tumor volume, offering a promising solution to a long-standing problem in cancer treatment. Additionally, the technology targets cancer stem cells in hypoxic zones, where conventional therapies struggle due to the absence of oxygen and functional blood vessels. In summary, the Starpax technology addresses a major&nbsp; critical issue of delivering drugs and immune cells effectively to every part of a tumor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Innovatively Addressing the Long-standing Treatment Issue</h2><p>Founded in 2018 by <strong>Michael Gareau (Founding President)</strong> and his team, Starpax Biopharma emerged from the acquisition of two patents focused on virtual monopole magnetic field vectors. Since then, the company has dedicated the efforts of 350 professionals and experts to develop an exceptional cancer treatment technology, resulting in 57 patents and pending applications. During preclinical trials on human tumors grown in animals, the technology showcased remarkable results, addressing a long-standing resistance problem in treatments that chemotherapy and immunotherapy have struggled with for over a century.&nbsp;</p><p>The Starpax Biopharma technology achieved a 100% remission rate reaching Complete Pathological Responses with no meaningful side effects. Unprecedented in cancer treatment, the technology simultaneously delivers three therapeutic benefits in a single treatment: localized chemotherapy throughout the tumor volume, penetration and accumulation in hypoxic zones targeting non-dividing stem cells (drivers of metastasis), and immunotherapy. This breakthrough garnered the attention of the financial community, securing $70 million to advance the project. Starpax established three laboratories and a state-of-the-art GMP Magnetodrones manufacturing plant and installed the first Polartrak in a hospital to prepare for upcoming clinical trials in 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Never-Before-Seen Breakthrough Technology</h2><p>The Starpax Biopharma technology is a never-before-seen technology for cancer treatment. The technology comprises two elements, the<strong> Magnetodrones,</strong> and the <strong>Polartrak</strong>, and one cannot work without the other.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The <strong>Magnetodrones</strong><strong>™</strong> consists of unique proprietary self-propelled non-pathogenic bacteria (Bn1-S) that are sensitive to very specific magnetic fields and transport an FDA-approved drug attached to their surface. They can swim within interstitial spaces between tumor tissues without the need for blood vessels. Magnetodrones™ is also aerotactic, meaning they naturally accumulate in the “low oxygen” hypoxic zones containing stem cells due to the oxygen level in the hypoxic zones being the same as in their culture medium. They bring an anticancer molecule proven to work in hypoxic areas where stem cells don’t divide. They are injected directly into the tumor, do not proliferate in the human body, and die within 60 minutes.</li></ul><ul><li>The <strong>Starpax PolarTrak</strong><strong>™ </strong>is a unique patented medical device, in which the patient is installed, designed to generate a magnetic sphere around the tumor to keep the Magnetodrones™ captive in the tumor. It produces virtual monopole magnetic field vectors that control the trajectory of the Magnetodrones™ in three dimensions with millimetric precision. The PolarTrak™ is controlled by artificial intelligence that defines, from MRI imaging data, the exact shape and volume of the tumor to force the Magnetodrones™ to spread throughout the whole volume of the tumor while releasing the drug along its path. Magnetic fields produced by the PolarTrak™ are safe for humans, as they are 2,000 times less powerful than those of an MRI.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Driven by Medical Mavericks</h2><p>At the helm of Starpax Biopharma, Michael spearheads the company at the forefront and constantly motivates the team to achieve the organizational mission. With 41 years of experience as a serial entrepreneur and CEO, Michael has played a pivotal role in various high-technology companies.&nbsp;</p><p>As the founder and managing director of Ipax Capital, he led the Ipax One Private Equity Co-investment Fund to be recognized as the “Best-Performing Buyout Funds” out of 20,500 PE funds globally.&nbsp;</p><p>Gareau, honored with the “Individual of Extraordinary Ability” by the United States Government in 1999, holds P. Eng., M.Sc. Adm, and MBA degrees.&nbsp;</p><p>His partners, Thierry Page, P.Eng.&nbsp; (COO)&nbsp; holds the ‘’Canada Qc/France Business Excellence’’ prize.</p><p>&nbsp;Andréanne Cyr, CFO&nbsp; is CPA with 10 years of experience with expertise as director on audit files for public companies and international files for a big five audit firm.She also has expertise in filing at the SEC.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Martel, the vice president and chief of technology, is renowned for inventing the virtual monopole magnetic field and holds the ‘’Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee’’ medal.</p><p>&nbsp;Starpax Biopharma’s departmental directors, each with 15 to 20 years of industry experience and Ph.D. qualifications, contribute to the company’s expertise.</p><p>Starpax Biopharma’s board of directors boasts a remarkable lineup featuring three recently retired presidents of major pharma, including André Monmette (Johnson & Johnson France), John Helou (Pfizer Canada), and Dr. Lisa Matar (Eli Lilly Canada). Berthe Latreille, the recently retired Managing Director and COO of JP Morgan EMEA Investment Bank, London, UK, adds her financial expertise.</p><p>Dr. Jacques Jolivet, MD, with 35 years of experience in clinical trials and a ‘’King George V Jubilee Medal in Oncology’’ recipient, contributes valuable insights into oncology. Pierre Dozois, a business lawyer with 40 years of experience and founding partner of BCF Law, brings legal expertise to the board. With such a seasoned and credible group, Starpax’s board ensures adherence to good practices and directs the company’s strategic initiatives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Leveraging a Strategic Position in the Market</h2><p>Beyond the medical breakthrough, Starpax Biopharma is strategically positioned to address a substantial market need. With the United States national healthcare expenditure projected to reach $6.2 trillion by 2029, Starpax targets solid tumors, representing 90% of cancers and 89% of cancer-related deaths. This translates to a massive global addressable annual market of $901 billion globally expected within the next five years.</p><p>To expedite its deployment plan, Starpax has engaged with medical marketing consultants, accounting firms, and industry experts. The company, holding over 57 patents and pending patents for its intervention, anticancer therapeutic Magnetodrones, and medical device PolarTrak, is in advanced discussions with a multinational industry partner. This strategic collaboration aims to construct turnkey Starpax Biopharma Cancer Centers in the U.S., equipped with proprietary Starpax technology, medical devices, and expert medical staff.</p><p>Additionally, Starpax plans to forge partnerships with 3 to 5 prestigious hospitals in the U.S., facilitating research and commercial treatment. The envisaged Starpax Cancer Center will have 10 PolarTraks, 2 MRI machines, 1 CT Scan, 1 Pet Scan, and all necessary monitoring and intervention accessories. The urgent need for 580 Starpax Care Centers in the U.S. (and 1200 across Europe) underscores the significant demand and potential impact of Starpax’s transformative <a href=#>cancer treatment </a>technology on a global scale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Trustworthy Name Amongst Patients&nbsp;</h2><p>Starpax earns a significant position in the industry, among the most trusted cancer-curing solution providers. However, the company ensures and incorporates several factors to earn the trust of patients and investors equally. As per studies, a significant issue in cancer treatment is systemic drug injections through blood vessels, resulting in approximately 90% of the tumor volume receiving little or no medication. This happens because the associated blood and lymphatic vessels become dysfunctional or collapse as tumors grow, hindering proper drug diffusion.</p><p>Unlike traditional approaches, Starpax Biopharma’s Magnetodrones, non-pathogenic bacteria carrying FDA-approved drugs, are directly injected into the tumor, avoiding reliance on compromised blood vessels. Guided by the Starpax Polartrak, these Magnetodrones navigate the tumor’s interstitial space of tumor tissues in three dimensions, ensuring comprehensive drug coverage throughout the tumor volume. This targeted approach stands as a more reliable solution compared to conventional methods.</p><p>Given that safety assurances are paramount for any therapeutic intervention, Starpax Biopharma’s Magnetodrones also meet this aspect with high standards. These non-pathogenic entities operate in magnetic fields 2,000 times weaker than standard hospital MRI machines, ensuring a secure medical application. The intratumoral injection of Magnetodrones distinguishes Starpax’s approach from systemic treatments that must navigate an extensive network of blood vessels, often with limited success. Starpax’s method ensures that 100% of the therapeutic dose reaches the tumor, starkly contrasting the mere 0.7% achieved by contemporary systemic therapeutics. The integrity of Starpax’s magnetic fields has been rigorously tested across various tissues and materials, including mice, rats, rabbits, pigs and even a one-inch stainless steel plate.</p><p>Additionally, Starpax’s commitment to quality extends to its manufacturing processes. For instance, operating its Magnetodrones manufacturing plant under GMP standards ensures Best in Class Aseptic production in compliance with rigorous FDA regulations. With over 50% of its workforce dedicated to quality control, it maintains multiple inspection levels throughout production full-time. This meticulous approach underscores Starpax’s dedication to delivering safe, effective therapeutic solutions.</p><p>Unlike other biopharma, Starpax sets itself apart as a Bio-Pharma-Tech by leveraging the synergy of microbiology, biochemistry, electromagnetism engineering, and artificial intelligence, which empowers the company to advance product innovations. Starpax’ groundbreaking technology addresses a critical challenge that traditional treatments, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy, struggle to overcome. Specifically, it targets and eliminates cancer cells throughout the tumor volume, including the challenging stem cells in hypoxic zones. Existing studies highlight the inefficiency of standard treatments in these hypoxic zones, where stem cells thrive and contribute to metastatic spread.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Triple-Threat Solution and Game-Changing Strategy for Investors</h2><p>“Investing in new cancer drugs is quite a risk for an investor. Statistics from the FDA mention that 97% of clinical trials of anticancer drugs fail. That means investors have a 97% chance of losing their money investing in new anticancer drugs. The good news is that Starpax doesn’t develop new drugs. It uses already FDA approved anticancer drugs attached to the Magnetodrones’ surface,” says Michael. For investors, Starpax Biopharma provides a safer and more promising solution. Firstly, the company takes a transparent approach to clinical trials, involving independent laboratories and multiple auditing firms for rigorous oversight. Unlike traditional trials focusing on rare cancers, Starpax simultaneously addresses six common cancer types, expediting the approval of seamless Phase1/2 commercial process.</p><p>Secondly, the company’s technology offers triple therapeutic benefits—localized chemotherapy, hypoxia therapy, and immunotherapy—ensuring effective and comprehensive treatment. With significant advantages such as minimal toxicity and no drug circulation in the bloodstream, the company’s approach simplifies cancer treatment while maintaining safety. Thirdly, as the US healthcare expenditure continues to rise, Starpax strategically targets solid tumors, which account for a vast majority of cancer cases and deaths. The company plans to establish Starpax Cancer Centers through partnerships, providing a turnkey solution with proprietary therapeutics, medical devices, and dedicated medical staff. This strategic initiative addresses the urgent need for advanced cancer care centers in the United States.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ushering a New Era in Medical Interventions</h2><p>Starpax’s innovative approach to cancer treatment accomplishes a new era in medical interventions. The company’s technology ensures a virtually side-effect-free patient experience and provides a unique three-in-one therapeutic benefit. Firstly, the Magnetodrones, paired with their drug payload, remain confined within the tumor, creating a localized chemotherapy effect. This is a breakthrough, as systemic treatments circulate drugs throughout the body, causing unintended side effects. The proprietary PolarTrak technology establishes a magnetic sphere around the tumor, preventing the Magnetodrones from circulating in the patient’s bloodstream.</p><p>Secondly, Starpax’s technology addresses hypoxic zones within tumors through its aerotactic Magnetodrones. These microorganisms seek refuge and accumulate in low-oxygen areas, a strategy that traditional therapies struggle to reach effectively. This hypoxia therapy is crucial, as it targets non-dividing stem cells, a primary driver of metastasis, where conventional treatments fall short. Thirdly, the living nature of the Magnetodrones triggers an immunotherapy response. By harnessing the body’s immune system, the now activated immune cells have the potential to attack cancer cells and metastases beyond the confines of the tumor, providing a holistic treatment approach without bringing any toxic drug in the patient’s body.</p><p>In other words, Starpax’s technology boasts several advantages. It delivers 50 times more drug directly to the tumor, significantly reducing the toxic impact on the patient’s body—800 times less toxicity compared to systemic chemotherapy. Importantly, nothing circulates in the bloodstream, mitigating side effects. The technology penetrates and accumulates in hypoxic zones, effectively targeting non-dividing stem cells, where traditional therapies struggle. The natural lifespan of the Magnetodrones, which die 60 minutes after injection, ensures they remain captive in the tumor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Analyzing Current Market Shifts for Effective Alignment</h2><p>The healthcare industry’s progress in developing new cancer treatments has been slow, with expiring patents and limited innovations from big pharmaceutical companies. Recognizing this challenge, Starpax Biopharma is pioneering a shift towards science-driven solutions, distinguishing itself from the trend of larger pharmaceutical acquiring smaller companies with advanced cancer products. While some progress has been made in recent decades, significant breakthroughs have been elusive.&nbsp;</p><p>In view of the current scenario of healthcare and especially cancer, Starpax’s cancer treatment technology focuses on solid tumors, which account for 90% of cancer cases and 89% of related deaths. Beyond cancer, the company envisions expanding its innovative technology to address non-cancer diseases caused by insufficient oxygen in tissues, especially in hypoxic areas. Starpax aims to broaden its pipeline to include conditions like Ischemic heart disease, Pulmonary hypertension, Acute Ischemic stroke in the brain, Diabetic retinopathy of the eyes, and other significant diseases lacking effective solutions.</p><p>These non-cancer markets present a substantial opportunity for impact and growth, potentially rivaling the current addressable cancer market for Starpax. The company’s multidisciplinary approach heralds a new era in cancer treatment and beyond, aligning with a vision where future healthcare companies resemble today’s tech giants more than traditional pharmaceutical entities. “Future healthcare companies will look more like today’s tech giants than large pharma companies. Starpax multidisciplinary technology is opening a new era in cancer treatment,” concludes Michael.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZMC1rdGpmLFlkp68sbTAq6SaZaOkubbAyKilZqyfYrCiusKeqQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kenny-loggins-75-seen-rare-public-outing-girlfriend-html.html><span>←</span><span>Kenny Loggins, 75, keeps it casual in sweater and ripped jeans on rare public outing with girlfriend</span></a>
