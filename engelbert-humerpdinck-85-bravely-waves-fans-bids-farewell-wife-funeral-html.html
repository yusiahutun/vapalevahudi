I'm sure all these little things I tried to do for her were instrumental in keeping her here longer than she should have been.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I used every kind of treatment for her. I took her to Germany for stem cells, I took her to acupuncture and electroacupuncture for years and that helped keep her going.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The doctor said it was the only thing that would work so we persevered with that, but then along came Covid and that changed the path. Now I'm left with long Covid, stupid little things like aches and pains, but the good part is my voice is still there. The Covid's hard to get rid of in a hurry, it's leaving me but it's taking its time.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He added:&nbsp;'The problem is that a spouse cannot heal a spouse, for some reason no healer can do that. The person that told me I had healing powers was a healer himself, but he couldn't heal his wife who had cancer.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It broke his heart. This is the same with every healer.' Was he able to heal anyone in his family with Covid?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'All I can tell you is that our prayer ritual was constant, every night at 8pm. I told people 8pm was the time of prayer, and prayers came from all over the world. It was a chain of prayer, and I felt those prayers at 8pm.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was the reader every night.
