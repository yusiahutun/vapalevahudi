Alabama, 17, took to TikTok last week with a video of her lip-syncing along to a song while wearing a brand-new wig.
The straight, long wig was in the color black, which was a switch from Alabama's typical blonde or red wigs she normally wears.
The teenager also was seen rocking a black, white, and red racer jacket, earrings that resembled a padlock, a few necklaces, and multiple rings."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
