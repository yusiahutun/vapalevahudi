To use it as a scalp treatment, divide your hair into four parts, exposing the scalp. Then, massage a small amount of oil and comb through your ends. Be sure to leave the oil in (a.k.a. don’t rinse it out). For daily use, apply a small amount to your scalp and comb through your ends. Lastly, to smooth split ends, rub the oil into your ends, put on a processing cap for 10 minutes and then rinse and shampoo.</span></p><p><span>If you need even more persuading, we’ll leave it to this product’s passionate stans.</span></p><p><span>“Slowly but surely </span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>helps with hair growth</span></a><span>!” wrote one five-star shopper. “Been noticing so many more baby hairs and my wide hair part is looking so much better. I put it on either on my scalp right before I hit the gym so it’s in my hair longer before a shower or I put it on for 15 minutes all over my scalp down to my ends before a shower.”</span></p><p><span>“This product works. I had thinning areas where I could see my scalp. I am now on my third bottle. I could see a difference within a couple of weeks,” another reviewer wrote.</span></p><p><span>Give your scalp and hair a complete makeover with the Rosemary Mint Scalp & Hair Strengthening Oil.
