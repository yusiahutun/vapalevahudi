Bernard Arnault, for example, has <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">given his children important roles</span></a> at his luxury conglomerate LVMH. His eldest child, Delphine Arnault, is the CEO of Dior. But some business leaders have made it clear that their kids won’t automatically inherit their parents’ empires and success.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mark Smucker, the CEO of J. M. Smucker, recently told Fortune that he had to earn his role and that members of the family wanting to work at the food company need to have experience working at another company “no matter what”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How did Lynsi Snyder become the CEO of In-N-Out Burger?</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/12/74310e46-50c1-49a8-af8f-63a40edb56b9_420b422f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lynsi became leader of the company following a series of deaths in the family. Her grandparents, Harry and Esther Snyder, opened the first In-N-Out location as a burger stand in Baldwin Park, Los Angeles County, in 1948. The restaurant’s two-way speaker drive-through system was seen as pioneering at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My grandparents, y’know, came from very humble beginnings,” Lynsi told Today.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">10 of the richest YouTubers ever – net worths, ranked, from KSI to PewDiePie</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After Harry died in 1976, his son – and Lynsi’s uncle – Rich Snyder took over the company until he died in a plane crash alongside another In-N-Out executive in 1993. Guy Snyder, father of Lynsi, then took charge until his death from a prescription drug overdose in 1999. His death made Lynsi, then 17, the only direct blood relative left.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/12/73d6c773-28d2-409f-bfb4-1bdaeabe04cc_1182755b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Business Insider reported that Lynsi’s rapid rise to the top was largely caused by the series of deaths and internal legal drama at the company. Since she became In-N-Out’s president in 2010, she has brought the chain to new states, but has changed almost nothing about the brand and its menu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In-N-Out now has just over 400 restaurants across eight states: California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas, Oregon, Colorado and Idaho. It’s announced plans to expand to Washington state, New Mexico and Tennessee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZp6mpJq%2Fta3Ip6SepqRkrrPAyJyjnmdjZ4J5g5hrZqadlal6r3nOrqtmmqWntKa%2BjKGcoqqVqMBuuNinqqJlo6PGpbHRZq6hp12svLO3xJ1kpKGkmLWmuoysn6KepKh6pLTAoqVmrJWau26uxJyYrquVYsCpsYydoJ2mpGLEorrT</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./latoia-fitzgerald-net-worth-baby-father-rajon-rondo.html><span>←</span><span>Get To Know Latoia Fitzgerald Net Worth, Baby Father, Parents</span></a>
