But not all hotels are created equal. Many are decidedly bland, with decor that makes one indistinguishable from the next. For those who appreciate individuality, there’s the Madonna Inn, a midcentury wonder in sunny San Luis Obispo, California. A quirky hotel that’s been in business more than 60 years, it features 110 elaborately decorated theme rooms, each uniquely styled. While its kitschy flair may not be for everyone, we think it’s <a href=#>an oddity worth visiting</a> (or even just admiring from afar). Here’s a bit of the lore behind the Madonna Inn and a look at what makes it so special.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Short History of the Madonna Inn</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Madonna Inn</a> is a sprawling property located on 1,000 acres of land. The first 12 rooms were built in 1958, and construction of the main inn began in 1960. Today, there are 110 unique rooms, each with a distinct theme and aesthetic. The hotel’s name comes from the inn’s founder, Alex Madonna, whose aim, according a 1975 article in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>, was to “create something that would be distinguishable from a run‐of‐the‐mill Holiday Inn.” He has no doubt succeeded.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Madonna and his wife, Phyllis, collaborated on the design, which features leaded glass work, hand-carved marble, large rocks sourced from the inn’s grounds, and bright bursts of color. (The hotel is known for its wholehearted embrace of pink — even the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tennis court</a> is pink!) In 1966, part of the inn was damaged in a fire; but not long after, it bounced back with the themed rooms that exist today, drawing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">curious travelers from all over the world</a>. In recent years, its bright colors have made it a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">social media staple</a>, and those who appreciate its vibrant ’60s style and playful <a href=#>nostalgia</a> simply can’t get enough of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/Paul-R.-Jones-shutterstock_780007138.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which room would you choose?&nbsp;</h2><p>While the Madonna Inn boasts <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">amenities</a> like a pool, a spa, hiking trails, horseback rides, and restaurants, the main attraction is, without question, the design. Should you visit the inn, the most difficult part of your stay will be choosing which of the 110 rooms to stay in. As the famed Italian author <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Umberto Eco</a> wrote, “the poor words with which natural human speech is provided cannot suffice to describe the Madonna Inn.” Truly, it must be seen to be believed.</p><p>Thankfully, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Madonna Inn’s website</a> has photos of every room. (Videos of the rooms can also be viewed on the inn’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> page.) You can easily spend an entire day clicking through them all. Themes include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">golf</a>, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wild west</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">antique cars</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">caves</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hearts and flowers</a>, to name only a few. There’s even a website section for rooms featuring “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rock waterfall showers</a>,” one of which also has green carpeting and a rainbow-painted ceiling. Clearly, at the Madonna Inn, minimalism is a no-go.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a tour of a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">room</a> with a working water wheel (definitely not something you’d expect to encounter in a hotel) and glittering green walls.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@madonnainn href=#>@madonnainn</a><p>Okay, but have you ever stayed in a hotel room with a working water wheel 🤠💦 <a title=madonnainn href=#>#MadonnaInn</a> <a title=california href=#>#California</a> <a title=themedhotel href=#>#ThemedHotel</a></p><a title="♬ Old Mill - Hot Day at the Zoo" href=#>♬ Old Mill – Hot Day at the Zoo</a></figure><p>The bathroom setup in the “Old-Fashioned Honeymoon” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">room</a> feels like something out of a storybook.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@madonnainn href=#>@madonnainn</a><p>Just looking for love and a nice <a title=bathtub href=#>#bathtub</a> ?

The fact that this inn is still standing — in all its ’60s glory — is a testament to the enduring power of Alex Madonna’s creative vision. Madonna’s style may be over-the-top, but as he told The New York Times, “the people are always happy” when staying there. To step into a candy-colored time machine, book a visit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJoq6uZppq5cMDHnmSmmZSku6%2BtjKKlpw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./palmers-face-oil-amazon.html><span>←</span><span>Palmer's Cocoa Butter Face Oil Treats Dark Spots &amp;amp; Fine Lines</span></a>
