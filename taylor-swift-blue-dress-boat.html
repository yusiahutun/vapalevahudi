The photo, which <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>can be seen here</a>, shows Swift alone on a boat at the dock in a blue dress and sunglasses. The song is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speculated to be about Swift’s ex-boyfriend</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Styles, who she dated from</a> October 2012 to January 2013.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/travis-kelce-kiss-marry-kill-taylor-swift.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/reba-mcentire-taylor-swift.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swift and Styles broke up</a> soon after the photo of her on the boat was taken, according to a report by <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Daily Mail</a> at the time. Per the publication, Swift and Styles went on vacation in the Virgin Islands for New Year’s after they spent Christmas together. The Daily Mail reported that, while on vacation, Swift and Styles broke up and Swift flew back home three days into the vacation on January 4, 2013—the same day the infamous “<a href=# id=auto-tag_taylor-swift data-tag=taylor-swift>Taylor Swift</a> in a blue dress on a boat” photo was taken. “Yes I can confirm they have split up. They were on holiday and had an almighty row,” an insider said. “They are two young stars at the top of their game so who knows what will happen in the future.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1989-taylor-swift.png><p>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</p><p>According to People, the photo of Taylor Swift in a blue dress on the boat was taken while was sitting in customs. Styles, meanwhile, stayed on the vacation and even paid a visit to business magnate Richard Branson’s private island. “Richard Branson heard Harry was staying nearby so invited him to come check out Necker,” a source told Business Insider at the time. “So when Taylor left for the states, Harry went to Branson’s island for the day to let off some steam.”</p><p>In the pre-chorus of “Is It Over Now?”, Swift seemed to call Styles a “lying traitor” and shade him for only dating models after their breakup. Following their split, Styles went on to date models like Georgia Fowler, Camille Rowe and Kendall Jenner. “Let’s fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh) / If she’s got blue eyes, I will surmise that you’ll probably date her (Oh, no) / You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh) / You search in every model’s bed for somethin’ greater, baby,” Swift sings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=taylor-swift-s-is-it-over-now-lyrics>Taylor Swift’s “Is It Over Now?” Lyrics</h2><p>Read Taylor Swift’s “Is It Over Now?” lyrics via <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Genius</a> ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>[Intro]</p><p>(Is it?
