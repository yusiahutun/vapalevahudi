After spending two years in CMLL, Garza joined AAA in 1996 as a new move to further his career.</p><h3>AAA /WWF Career</h3><p>Hector joined AAA in 1996, which was another step up for the great wrestler.</p><p>With his AAA contract, Garza could also appear in the WWF, a US-based World Wrestling Federation.</p><p>When he wrestled in his first televised appearance in the WWF, he won against T.L.

Such victories, accolades, and popularity kept coming into Hector’s life no matter where he was.</p><p>His arrest and deportation did not stop him from becoming a successful wrestler in Mexico.</p><h3>Returning to CMLL</h3><p>The 2-generation wrestler, Garza, came back to Mexico and joined CMLL in 2005. He fully got involved in CMLL.</p><p>After his return, Hector became a part of Los Perros del Mal, a Mexican professional wrestling group.</p><p>Again in 2008, Hector teamed with El Hijo del Fantasma and La Mascara.</p><p>In the final tournament, the trio won the vacant CMLL World Trios Championship defeating Dos Caras Jr., Blue Panther, and Mistico.</p><p>Moreover, Garza left the ring during the match in March 2010 in a feud with another team member.</p><p>In defense, Garza claimed that one member of his team attacked him. After this incident, Hector’s role as a tecnico (good guy character) started to change.</p><p>He kept winning many matches, teaming with different wrestlers than his team members.</p><p>Finally, on May 7, 2010, Super Viernes, Hector, betrayed his team members (La Mascara & Hijo del Fantasma) by attacking them.</p><p>Moreover, he let La Ola Amarillo win the CMLL Trios Championship. This final betraying move turned him into a “rudo” (bad-guy character).</p><h3>2010-2012</h3><p>In 2010, the talented wrestler Garza joined the Los Invasores after betraying his team members.</p><p>Moreover, Hector and Mr. Aguila won the CMLL World Tag Team Championship on July 16, 2010, Super Viernes.</p><p>But after four-month, they lost the championship to Dragon Rojo Jr. and Ultimo Guerrero.</p><p>Similarly, Hector went even further and participated in New Japan Pro Wrestling on January 4, 2011, which did not go well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hector-Garza-240x300.png><p>Soon after, Garza returned to CMLL.

The Los Perros del Mal kicked Hector out on August 10, 2012.</p><p>Sadly, two months later, Hector’s fans and followers got terrible news. On October 15, 2012, a press release confirmed his illness. He was diagnosed with lung cancer.</p><h2>Hector Garza | Steroids Arrest</h2><p>In 2005 the great wrestler Hector got arrested in Houston, Texas, the USA, for carrying steroids (Primobolan, Deca-Durabolin).</p><p>He was there to wrestle at TNA’s Final Resolution 2005.</p><p>When he got arrested, Garza said that those were prescribed drugs and admitted that he was unaware of steroids’ illegality in the United States.</p><p>Unfortunately, this incident ended Hector’s Career in the US. Later, he was deported back to Mexico and was stopped from entering the US.</p><p>Yet, he continued his wrestling career successfully in his own country.</p><h2>Hector Garza | Death & Legacy</h2><p>After battling cancer for a year, Hector passed away on May 26, 2013.
