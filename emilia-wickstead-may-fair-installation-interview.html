The designer – who set up her business almost exactly a decade ago – has made a name for herself in a market which, over the last few years, has tended to steer away from dressing up. We sat down with her to discuss why she will never tire of designing for women who want to look sophisticated, her secrets for dressing immaculately and just what makes London Fashion Week so special.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I am a big believer in dressing up and it is very much part of my business and my brand identity,” she says. “There is definitely an air to dressing now that is more relaxed but I think it’s all about having the perfect balance.”</p><img alt="Emilia Wickstead spring/summer 2018" title="Emilia Wickstead spring/summer 2018" width=4000 height=2500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emilia-wickstead-ss18-1537191594.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Emilia Wickstead spring/summer 2018</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wickstead, in relation to her personal style, says that she too has embraced our tendency to dress more casually and will often team an elegant dress with a pair of Stan Smiths, rather than heels as she once may have done. But she says that it is so important to keep in mind that feeling we get when we do dress up – and this is just what she wants to encourage with her label.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It is important to remember how excited we feel when we dress up. There is nothing quite like it. I fear this is something we will forget in this new age of being more casual, but when you do dress up, you remember how special it makes you feel.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wickstead thinks that a woman needs a just few items in her wardrobe in order to achieve the relaxed elegance that so many of those who wear her clothes are known for.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You definitely need a great dress and a pair of cigarette trousers that are perfectly cut. Team the trousers with an oversized T-shirt, a shirt or a turtleneck – you will immediately feel chic and powerful. It is so easy to achieve.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“With my label, I also want women to have a dress that will be in their wardrobes for years and when they pull it out a decade after it was bought, it will still be sophisticated and feminine, but also feel fashion-forward and relevant. To have this in a dress is key to having a great capsule wardrobe.”</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop Emilia Wickstead<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><img alt="Emilia Wickstead autumn/winter 2019" title="Emilia Wickstead autumn/winter 2019" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emilia-wickstead-aw18-1537191730.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Emilia Wickstead autumn/winter 2019</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her autumn collection – which is made up of the elegant dresses, tailored trousers and breathtaking evening gowns that she is so well known for – was the inspiration for her latest LFW installation at The May Fair Hotel, a partnership that has been ongoing for three seasons now. This time around, Wickstead says she wanted to showcase her label in a different way, having previously put together window vinyls or used a print that is symbolic to the brand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was all about impact. I thought it would be quite interesting to showcase the brand in a different way and to use something that is relevant right now as this is the collection that is just hitting the stores.”</p><img alt="Emilia Wickstead" title="Emilia Wickstead" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emilia-1537192217.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Emilia Wickstead</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two beautiful gowns from the most recent autumn collection have been displayed on stands with the print covering the windows behind. As well as this, Wickstead has curated a cocktail menu entitled 'The Emilia Collection' which guests will be able to enjoy during LFW as well as a number of other Emilia Wickstead-inspired touches throughout the hotel.</p><img alt="Emilia Wickstead" title="Emilia Wickstead" width=2000 height=2800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emilia-wickstead-profile-2-1537184891.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Emilia Wickstead</span></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although this season’s offering was very much inspired by her current collection, creating window installations is a unique, and quite different, approach to design from her day-to-day job. However, this is nothing new for the designer who has, in the last year, created activewear and homeware, alongside her ready-to-wear collections.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Designing in these different ways actually feels quite natural which is great. I obviously feel very fortunate that I am a female – I exercise, I go to work, I entertain, I got out in the evenings. What is amazing about that and what excites me is that I am able to cater to all those different types of women. I love expanding the brand and being able to offer something to everybody that has our DNA all over it. That is something I have truly loved doing this year.”</p><img alt="Emilia Wickstead activewear" title="Emilia Wickstead activewear" width=2000 height=2700 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emilia-wickstead-bodyism-3-1520855568.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Emilia Wickstead</span><p>Emilia Wickstead’s first activewear collection for Bodyism</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, the designer showed her spring/summer 2019 collection to the fashion pack during London Fashion Week, something she has been doing since her very first on-schedule show in 2012. Has LFW changed much? Not in the ways that matter, Wickstead says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think London Fashion Week is consistent for me and for the people that come here for the shows – there is still the same unmistakable excitement and buzz. When I was at university at Central Saint Martins, which was quite some time ago, that buzz is what LFW was renowned for. It was what we represented and stood for as designers and so when I started my brand, that was what I was so eager to be a part of and I think it continues to have that reputation. It’s very much an original trait and we are very lucky to have it.”</p><img alt="Emilia Wickstead spring/summer 2018" title="Emilia Wickstead spring/summer 2018" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emilia-wickstead-spring-2018-1537191646.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Emilia Wickstead spring/summer 2018</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Emilia Wickstead autumn/winter 2018" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/18bd6a2a-5f37-4eae-a1f9-ad60f7d9d3c8/thumb_1280x720_00001_1536936331_79112.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And, despite the ever-increasing presence of social media surrounding fashion week, Wickstead doesn’t believe that we will ever lose the physical show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I am into the touch and feel and experience of being in the moment,” she says. “I love the idea of walking into a room and having the real-life experience. Of course it is wonderful to be able to instantly see a show and have more people be able to be a part of it, but nothing can compare to being there and being in the space. It’s sort of like being at a concert. It’s really quite special and I hope it continues forever.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Emilia’s installation is on at The May Fair Hotel until 23 September.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wGtqampnZ4N5e8SmoKWhkWLEqq%2FKrKuemZRiuqLFjJ%2BYoqpdnru0wMClo5qsmaS7brXNrZyrrpmaxHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./8-extraordinary-facts-about-national-stadium-dublin.html><span>←</span><span>8 Extraordinary Facts About National Stadium (Dublin)</span></a>
