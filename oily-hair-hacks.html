The good news is that you don’t have to suffer the indignities of oily hair any more:&nbsp;here are some easy (and seriously brilliant) oily hair hacks to help you beat scalp grease this season.</p><p><strong>Translucent powder will de-slick you on the go.</strong><br>How many times has this happened to you: you’re out and about, when suddenly you catch a glimpse of yourself in a mirror and realize your hair is a giant greaseball. Though you may not have a can of <a href=# id=auto-tag_dry-shampoo data-tag=dry-shampoo>dry shampoo</a> with you, you can address minor-level oil by dusting a little bit of translucent setting powder along your part and into your roots. It soaks up oil just as well as dry shampoo does, and because it’s so fine, you won’t end up with any weird white residue left behind. Plus, you never have to worry about carrying&nbsp;a can of dry shampoo with you—one fewer products in our bag is always a good thing.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/dry-shampoo.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/hair-spray-adobe.png><p><strong>Be smart with your dry shampoo.</strong><br>We hate to say it, but overusing dry shampoo could actually be causing your extra-<a href=# id=auto-tag_greasy-hair data-tag=greasy-hair>greasy hair</a>. It’s really easy for this product to soak up too much oil, which dries out your scalp, which causes it to produce even more oil—thus causing the exact problem you set out to fix. It’s time to stop the madness, and the easiest way to do this is by dry shampooing smarter. Instead of blasting your scalp, spray a little dry shampoo on your fingers and run them through your hair, focusing mainly on the roots—not your scalp. You can also spray a little dry shampoo onto a paddle brush and comb it through your hair to refresh your lovely locks without drying them out.</p><p><strong>Embrace curls.</strong><br>Ditching your straightener might be the best thing you ever do for oily hair: the straighter your hair is, the more scalp-oil it comes into contact with. Some curl at the root lifts your hair up where it belongs, making it harder to get greasy. We find that curls created with rollers rather than hot tools work best on grease-prone hair—just make sure you hit your waves with a blast of hard-hold hairspray to get them to stay.</p><p><strong>DIY a color-safe clarifying shampoo.</strong><br>One of the best ways to eliminate grease permanently is to use a clarifying shampoo—unless you have colored hair, of course. Clarifying shampoos are notorious for fading and stripping color from dyed hair, and who wants that? Instead, crush up a baby aspirin and mix it in with your usual shampoo. The salicylic acid will cleanse your hair (and scalp) without removing any of your color.</p><p>Bonus tip: Apple cider vinegar is also meant to be a great home remedy for super-oily hair. Mix two tablespoons of ACV into a cup of warm water, and after you’ve shampooed your hair, pour the mixture through as a final rinse. The smell is pretty particular and does last, but it also gives pretty decent results. Attempt at your own risk.</p><p><strong>Rinse properly.</strong><br>If you get greasy in one particular area (like the back of your head), it could be a sign that you’re not rinsing all the shampoo or conditioner out of your hair. Instead of moving to an apartment with better water pressure and hoping for the best, section your hair into quarters to make sure you’re really getting clean. First part your hair down the center and rinse well; then part it again from ear to ear and rinse again. Voila, perfectly clean hair.</p><p>Bonus tip: We don’t know why this works, but we’ve found that doing a final rise with very cold water works wonders in terms of keeping excess oil at bay. It’s not the most fun, especially this time of year, but the results are amazing.</p><p><strong>MORE: <a href=#>10 Brilliant Lipstick Hacks</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWitdFmpZqhnKh8dYSXam9wZ5%2Beubp5x5qgq2WYlrCsv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./64d67a3b46163fabbf8b4583-html.html><span>←</span><span>LaLiga Santander 2023: LaLiga comienza con nuevas reglas y partidos que pueden durar hasta 100 minut</span></a>
