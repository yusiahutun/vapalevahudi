I don't need to tell you that the <a class=hm-link href=#>Barbie movie</a> - starring <a class=hm-link href=#>Margot Robbie</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Ryan Gosling</a> - is one of the most talked-about movies of 2023. Like a lot of kids, I loved my Barbie dolls and nowadays I'm a devoted pink lover at the age of 39, but this Barbie movie (and mainly <a class=hm-link href=#>Margot Robbie's insane IRL Barbie wardrobe</a>) has taken it all up a notch. I'm suddenly Barbie obsessed.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eB0U_1xFE6 data-wc=74>l mean, look at me! Here I am driving around my home town in a hot pink glittery Mini Cooper. I wish I could say it was mine, but alas it was a loan to celebrate the launch of the Barbie movie. <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">SIXT UK</a></span> created the Barbie-style Mini Convertible ahead of the launch of the movie. With uber-bright sparkly exterior and pink steering wheel, dashboard and seats to boot, it was quite the head-turner.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/74e9d4044685-leanne-bayley-driving-pink-mini.jpg><p id=eCJMLdGhnvL data-wc=40>Which leads me on to the collaborations taking place in the run-up to the movie's releases. Yes, a lot of brands are jumping on the Barbie™ bandwagon, and why shouldn't they?! It's a cash cow and (pink) money seriously talks.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eQofgMdzr8U data-wc=43>In fact, the world is turning pink and the new Barbiecore trend has been rising through the ranks for the last year. Google Trends, Pinterest and social media platforms have all shown a marked increase in the number of searches for Barbiecore-related content.</p><h2 dir=ltr>How we chose the best Barbie collaborations</h2><ul><li dir=ltr><strong>Trademark:</strong> I wanted genuine partnerships in this edit - and not just 'brand releases a pink collection'. It's still great, but it's not a genuine partnership.&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Fun factor:</strong> This edit is full of fun things to buy if you've been inspired after watching the movie. You won't need any of this stuff, but you will want it.&nbsp;</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Price point: </strong>I don't want you spending thousands of points on Barbie merch, so I've tried to keep costs down.</li></ul><p id=ey0r4yhB6Kd data-wc=7>Let's look into the best Barbie collabs…&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie™ x Zara Collaboration&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/410b3bb2013b-barbie-zara-for-story.jpg><p id=eIw0oH6SrKR data-wc=107>When Zara dropped its highly anticipated collaboration with Mattel (aka Barbie™) I couldn't resist the range of pink, sparkly and quirky products. Yes, for research purposes I spent a good amount of time scrolling the Zara website, adding to the virtual basket in a panic, watching as items sold out before my eyes. I heard myself saying "Do I need a Barbie necklace?" to which my sister shouted out from the other room "Leanne, you're not five!" Fair point, but this Barbie mania has said 'hey girl' to my inner child and if I want a £29.99 Barbie necklace I'll have one, and you can't stop me. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5603b1fa4a10-barbie-zara-lunchbox.jpg><p id=eZF9fCTWt3x data-wc=75>And yes, I spent a good 30 extra seconds wondering if I needed a Barbie™ lunchbox for my trips to the office. Just like a drunken splurge, I've since had a moment to breathe and I'm glad I didn't actually buy that. I did buy some pink sparkly jeans, a pink bodysuit with rhinestone 'Barbie' emblems, a Barbie T-shirt, and gosh, a lot more. The bank might think a 10-year-old has stolen my debit card.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie™ x Superga Collaboration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e9a903f3950-barbie-superga.jpg><p id=eKd4M5ES01 data-wc=57>Princess Kate is often associated with the trainer brand Superga, but now she has been out-shined by a blonder famous face - Barbie. Superga has joined forces with Barbie™ The Movie to develop an exclusive capsule collection inspired by the iconic doll whose bright pink universe excites and empowers women of all ages all over the world.</p><p id=eq9g4CTaQmt_ data-wc=65>There are four pairs to choose from, and they're all as adorable as the other. If you're in the mood for a platform, well you've got it! Barbie would be a lot taller than Ken if she wore the 2802 pair with an eight-centimetre pink sole. I personally love the most simplest of the range - the 2750, which features colourful Barbie-themed metal laces pins.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie™ x Beis Collaboration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0f1869e466a2-barbie-beis.jpg><p id=emk50Oo_hRqN data-wc=68>I actually want to cry as this is only available in the US, but I have to feature it here for any readers looking at this stateside. Trust Shay Mitchell (the founder of Beis) to bring out the most epic collection Barbie™ pink luggage. There's a waitlist for everything and it's clear to see why. From the Carry-On Roller to The Mini Weekender, The Cosmetic Case and more.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>&nbsp;Barbie™ x Emu Australia Collaboration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f05f9581d0ad-barbie-emu-gem.jpg><p id=emB5myaw68Ue data-wc=20>Barbie and pink are just two words that go together, and do you know another word that just works? Gemstones.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKru1hh475dz data-wc=36>As someone who adores sparkle, I can see why my grown-up Barbie gal pals would love the Barbie™ Mayberry Gems slippers. If you're more into a bootie, fear not those are available too - sans gems.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie™ x Primark Collaboration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/926cd3ba4c70-primark-barbiethemovie-ref1600434.jpg><p id=eKsIYoJD2a-T data-wc=33>If you want pink, you want neon, you want Venice Beach-worthy swimwear, Primark has you covered. You just know this will be an instant hit, and the affordable range starts from just £1.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie™ x GAP Collaboration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dd99308f0930-barbie-gap.jpg><p id=eoYIBNI7-YF- data-wc=77>GAP was one of the first to launch its Barbie collection. Combining the timeless style of Gap's signature product icons with classic Barbie™ branding, you can expect bright pink and white graphic t-shirts, embroidered vests, logo hoodies, patterned cycling shorts, a denim skirt, a denim jacket, a striped shirt, a dress, a cap, and a ‘KEN’ t-shirt, too. The new Barbie™ collab is for adults, kids and toddlers, so the whole family can sport matching Barbie™ looks.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie™ x Ruggable Collaboration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3fcdcd3d34c0-barbie-ruggable.jpg><p id=eD-pfqr-czHg data-wc=60>It's not just the fashion brands - homeware brands are getting in on the action too. The Barbie™ x Ruggable Collection features bold, joyful designs that are washable and wait until you see the Barbie doormat - it's the perfect way to bring your Barbie dream home to life. It looks like this collection is just available in the US.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>&nbsp;Barbie™ x NYX Cosmetics Collaboration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e0842bce60b2-barbie-nyx.jpg><p id=e7yMqzflCglB data-wc=88>Where would Barbie be without her blue eyeshadow, pink blush and bright lips? Luckily, NYX has a limited-edition assortment inspired by the vibrant colours and electrifying energy in the movie; featuring two credit card sized mini shadow palettes with a collectible mini Butter Gloss keychain attachment; a mini cheek palette including two blushes and a highlighter to bring the sun-kissed looks from the movie to life. There are lots more, but the mirror compact that's shaped like a flip phone is definitely an Instagram photo waiting to happen.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Barbie™ x Fossil Collaboration</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/38ec75bc24e0-barbie-fossil.jpg><p id=e1Xw5hY8Amfh data-wc=64>Live your Barbie™ dreams in Fossil's new collab, inspired by the global icon herself.
