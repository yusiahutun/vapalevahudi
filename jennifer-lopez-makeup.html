It’s a long-wearing, buildable, medium coverage, radiant finish liquid concealer that stays on for up to 16 hours, per the brand.</p><p>With over 8,000 five-star reviews on Sephora, one shopper wrote, “I have tried nearly every concealer Sephora has and this one’s my holy grail. It’s so lightweight, creamy, buildable, and does not crease! it has a radiant finish and doesn’t cling onto dry patches, which I love. Seriously don’t think, just buy!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/yves-saint-laurent-touche-eclat-concealer-pen-sephora.png><p>Later on, while the singer is contouring, she whips out another concealer. She uses <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>YSL’s Touche Éclat pen</a> down the bridge of her nose, under her eyes, and on a couple of other spots where she wants to illuminate.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8788819875776><h2>Foundation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/chanel-vitalumiere-foundation.png><p>Loved by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner</a>, and J.Lo (she says she’s been mixing three different shades “for years”), this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Chanel foundation</a> is super hard to find in stock anywhere and has actually been out of stock at Chanel for a long, long time. Thankfully, it’s back in stock so you can cop the formula that gives you the most beautiful, dewiest complexion.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5370919881306><h2>Eyeshadow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tom-ford-eyeshadow-quad-palette-sephora.png><p>Tom Ford Eye Color Quad Eyeshadow Palette</p><p>Lopez keeps it simple with a neutral-toned <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Tom Ford eyeshadow quad</a>. She uses three brown shades to create a natural-looking eye.</p><p>However, she isn’t the only fan of this palette. One Sephora reviewer raved, “This product completely changed my eyeshadow game. When applied with fingers, the matte shades feel like velvet. The shades are also highly pigmented and are the best shadows I have ever used. They are a staple in every look. Once you’ve used them, your standards for shadows will go sky-high. Best shadows. Ever.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.7230769230769><h2>Blush</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/beautyblender-bounce-liquid-whip-cream-blush-sephora.png><p>I would’ve never guessed the singer uses a $22 <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Beautyblender blush</a> to achieve her signature sun-kissed glow. “I like cream blush, especially when you get a little older,” J.Lo says in the Vogue video. She likes the shade Playful Peach so much that she used it in her last movie.</p><p>“This product is one of the best. It blends into the skin for a natural-looking blush. Blends effortlessly and lasts all day,” wrote one Sephora shopper. “Can we mention [it’s] affordable?”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.3772791023843><h2>Lip Liner</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/make-up-for-ever-artist-color-pencil.png><p>Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil Brow, Eye & Lip Liner</p><p>J.Lo and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Mrs. Bieber</a> just keep using the same makeup products. Here’s another one: <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Make Up For Ever’s brow, eye, and lip liner</a>. The singer says “I’m obsessed, it’s my new fave” as she outlines her pout in her Beauty Secrets video and shows viewers a technique she learned from social media.</p><p>The multifunctional pencil has a 4.4-star overall rating on Sephora, with one happy shopper saying, “My favorite lip liner EVER. Wherever Walnut is the perfect shade for me. Has great wearing time and doesn’t come off even after applying gloss. Worth the hype.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.0625><h2>Lip Gloss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/fenty-beauty-gloss-bomb-universal-lip-luminizer-sephora.png><p>Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer</p><p>It seems like everyone and their grandmas is a fan of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fenty Beauty’s Gloss Bomb</a>. Add Lopez to the long, long list of stans because she uses multiple shades of this lip gloss. She applies a warmer, orange-peach shade all over her lips, and sometimes she’ll go in with a light pink shade to add a little extra dimension to her pout (not that she needs it; her pout is to die for).</p><p>This lip product is a Sephora favorite, boasting over 9,000 five-star reviews. One shopper raved, “The most beautiful lip gloss I’ve ever tried. My jaw genuinely dropped when I swatched it for the first time. NEED.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.1793831168831><h2>Brow Pencil</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/anastasia-beverly-hills-brow-whiz-pencil-sephora.png><p>On Sale % off</p><p>I couldn’t be more envious of J.Lo’s arches, which she fills in with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Anastasia Beverly Hills’ Brow Whiz</a>. One end has the pencil and the other has a spoolie. In the GRWM, you can see the singer brush her brow hairs up and then fill them in.</p><p>Some shoppers love the pencil so much that they keep coming back to it. One Sephora reviewer wrote, “I have been through a few different brow pencils now and I must say this one has been my favorite! It blends out nicely and the color matched my natural brows perfectly.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.0891304347826><h2>Setting Powder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/make-up-for-ever-ultra-hd-microfinishing-loose-powder-sephora.png><p>Make Up For Ever Ultra HD Microfinishing Loose Powder</p><p>A makeup look is almost never complete without dabbing some setting powder under your eyes and on your T-zone (where you tend to get oily). J.Lo opts for this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Make Up For Ever loose powder</a>, which is ultra-blurring and light-diffusing, per the brand.</p><p>If this shopper review doesn’t sell you on this product, I don’t know what will: “Tried many over the years and I always come back to this! Super fine translucent powder and does not look cakey at all! Trust this for fine lines and setting under the eyes. Also takes the shine away from [the] T-zone [and] keeps the base look[ing] super natural. Matte finish, no cake, no coverage, and no color. Perfect for [the] last step [of] your makeup routine. I don’t experience any white flashbacks. A little goes a long way!”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.9757489300999><h2>Mascara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/it-cosmetics-superhero-mascara-amazon.png><p>IT Cosmetics Superhero Mascara</p><p>On Sale % off</p><p>My ears perked up when J.Lo said in the YouTube video, “This is the most important part.” The essential step she’s talking about is her <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>mascara</a>.
