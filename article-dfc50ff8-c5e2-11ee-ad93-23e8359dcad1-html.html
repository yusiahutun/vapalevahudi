Born on March 16, 1944, in Hattiesburg, Robert was the beloved son of Leon Gilbert Tullos and Carrie Lee Gambrell Tullos. Raised in Summerland, he spent his boyhood days immersed in the joys of playing, fishing and hunting with his brothers Don and Gilbert.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Robert's life journey took him to Houston, Texas, where he trained to become a mortician. Returning to Laurel, he began his career at Memory Chapel and later transitioned to the Office Supply Company, becoming a familiar and trusted figure in the community. His entrepreneurial spirit led him to become self-employed, supplying churches across the Southeastern United States with essential supplies and furniture.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Amidst the chapters of his career, a special segment of his life was shared with Cheryl Tullos. Their story, woven with love and mutual growth, left an indelible mark on his journey. Though they later parted ways, the time they spent together remained a cherished memory, a testament to life's complex tapestry of relationships.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Robert's heart held a special place for his daughter Jill McDaniel. As her biggest fan, he was a constant presence in her life, supporting her through cheerleading, pageants and every milestone. Their bond was a beautiful testament to the love and strength found in a father-daughter relationship. Robert's pride in Jill's accomplishments was evident to all who knew him. He was her unwavering pillar of support, her confidant and a guiding star.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He is lovingly remembered by Jill, who was the apple of his eye, and her husband, Sen. Chris McDaniel.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Robert's legacy continues through his grandsons Chamberlain and Cambridge, whose sports and adventures were a constant source of pride and joy. He is also survived by his brothers Don Tullos and his wife Jane, and Gilbert Tullos and his wife Carolyn; and several nieces and nephews. Robert's faithful dog Dak was more than a pet; he was a loyal companion and fur baby.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Robert's life was a tapestry of rich experiences and relationships. Known as one of the best storytellers in Mississippi, he had a knack for captivating an audience with his tales. His great smile, infectious laughter and the twinkle in his eyes could light up any room. He never met a stranger, and his mischievous grin was a testament to his playful spirit. To know Robert was to love him; his charm and charisma made him a beloved figure throughout Mississippi.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Visitation for Robert will be Friday at Memory Chapel in Laurel from noon until 2:00 p.m. A memorial service celebrating his life will follow at 2 p.m. The family invites friends, loved ones and those whose lives were touched by Robert to join in remembering and honoring a remarkable man.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Instead of flowers, donations may be made to the Laurel Animal Rescue League, a cause close to Robert's heart.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Robert Samuel Tullos, a true Southern gentleman, and a cherished soul, will be deeply missed but never forgotten, leaving us more than just memories.&nbsp;Robert leaves a legacy of love, laughter and stories that will continue to echo through the hearts and minds of those who were fortunate enough to know him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As we bid him farewell, we hold onto his words, "See you in a little while," a promise of a reunion in a place where the magnolias bloom forever, and the stories never end.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnoqSvpr7TZqqapaWauW7A1KWjqKtdoq6zr8dmaG9lYW6BdXmMZp2eml1renN8kW1mmqqknrCtsb6dnZxtYJuzeXnCbpxrZWFmsqZ5wJ1wbGViaLJ5f5Rym5yZlGZ7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-bacons-two-photos-35-years-apart-prove-absolutely-nothing-has-changed.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Bacon's two photos 35 years apart prove absolutely nothing has changed</span></a>
