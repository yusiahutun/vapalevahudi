"In my home, I'm very lucky about having these two babies and my husband. They make it all better. It's changed my life."</p><p>Although the "Saturday Night Live" alum isn't currently working on a set, she's still promoting her new film and therefore isn't "as present as [she] would like to be" at home.</p><p>"It's really hard because I'm always convinced they'll forget who I am if I'm gone for a day," Wiig said with a laugh. "I have looked at my children and been like, 'I am your mother.'"</p><p>"There's something really nice about being home with them all the time," she shared. "They are really young right now so I feel like I have that as an advantage. They don't really know when I'm not there."</p><p>"That time is coming and I'm going to do my best to balance and they will come first."</p><p>Wiig and Rothman were first linked back in 2016. The very private couple became engaged in 2019. The two welcomed twins via surrogate in June 2020 following a <a href=#>difficult journey</a> to become parents.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> in December, Wiig shared how motherhood has changed her perspective on life.</p><p>"It's the best," she told the outlet at the time. "I know everyone always says that, and everyone says, like, it changes how you look at the world and how you, like, see love. Now it's just, like, such a bigger thing, and all of that stuff is so true."</p><p>"Especially being in this business, you're on your own a lot, and you make your own decisions. It can be very sort of, like, an isolated existence," she added. "Now that I have kids, it's like, 'Oh, I don't want this to be about me, I don't wanna think about me anymore.'"</p><a id=gallery-link-a22583a1-ee8b-4405-b8b8-b389d3b55b75 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:a22583a1-ee8b-4405-b8b8-b389d3b55b75 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:9e887071-3ed8-4421-a330-49e6a77d0c58 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/5e/4by3/2021/02/08/5e243e8fe6a843d69a073848eca36cec_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2tmamlfoL%2Bqv9OepWavmZ60brjOsKKesV2Wu6%2B71KeanpxdqLWmecyaqauhlZl6osLIZqmorJiirq97</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./actress-marin-hinkle-living-a-blissful-married-life-with-husband-randall-sommer-know-about-her-family-and-children.html><span>←</span><span>Actress Marin Hinkle is living a blissful married life with husband Randall Sommer since 1998: See t</span></a>
