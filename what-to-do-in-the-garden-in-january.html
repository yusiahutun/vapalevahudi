So, if you have somewhere warm and bright, such as a heated greenhouse or a warm sunny windowsill, you can start them off now.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Fill a 9cm pot, or seed tray with compost. Tamp the soil down to create a firm surface, and then sow <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/gardens/a37450096/harvest-plant-seeds/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="several seeds" class="body-link css-199th1 et3p2gv0">several seeds</a>, 1cm apart.

Seeds can take between 8-21 days to germinate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Once seedlings have grown their true leaves (these follow on from seed leaves and look similar to the foliage of the mature plant), plant seedlings individually into 9cm pots, and water in. Place pot somewhere warm and bright, such as a heated greenhouse or conservatory to grow on. Remember to keep soil moist.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">3. Sow microgreens</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Mustard and watercress are an easy and quick crop to grow. Fill a pot or container with damp compost, then sow thinly across the top. Next, place the container somewhere warm, where germination should occur quickly. Once you see shoots growing, transfer the container to a warm, sunny kitchen windowsill where they can be easily reached when preparing a meal.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">4. Rhubarb<br></h2><img alt="what to do in the garden in january rhubarb" title="what to do in the garden in January - rhubarb" width=2000 height=1428 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/what-to-d-in-the-garden-in-january-rhubarb-1641565239.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd2">Ade Sellars</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">For an early crop of rhubarb, place a rhubarb forcer, or a large container (turned upside down), over the emerging rhubarb. By keeping the crown in darkness, you’re forcing the stalks to grow quickly as they search for light. After eight weeks, the stalks should be 20-30cm long, sweet tasting and ready to eat.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">5. Harvest veg</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Continue to harvest vegetables from your <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.countryliving.com/uk/homes-interiors/gardens/a37753000/fruit-vegetables-plant-grow-autumn/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="veg plot" class="body-link css-199th1 et3p2gv0">veg plot</a>. Remove any yellowing or fallen brassica leaves, as they could be hiding pests. Once veg beds are empty, turnover the soil and add a thick layer of well-rotted organic matter, or compost. The winter weather will help breakdown the mulch, releasing its valuable nutrients into the soil. The matter will also help improve soil structure.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">6. Potatoes</h2><img alt="what to do in the garden in january chitting potatoes" title="what to do in the garden in January chitting potatoes" width=1428 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/what-to-do-in-the-garden-in-january-chitting-potatoes-1641565385.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd2">Ade Sellars</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">If you haven’t ordered your seed potatoes, do it now. The sooner they arrive, the sooner you can start chitting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Chitting is speeding up the aging process of a tuber. When you come to plant out your tubers in mid-March, they’ll have grown long tendrils, giving them a head start. To chit seed potatoes, stand them apart with their eyes facing upwards. Empty egg boxes make ideal holders.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Then, place them somewhere warm and bright, such as a kitchen windowsill or warm greenhouse. Check them regularly, and in six weeks your tubers will be ready to plant out.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">7. Store fruit & veg</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Any fruit or veg currently in storage should be checked regularly to ensure they haven’t spoilt. Turn them over, and remove any decaying or damaged produce. Ensure they aren’t touching, as this will encourage a good airflow around them.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">8. Plant maintenance<br></h2><img alt="what to do in the garden in january" title="what to do in the garden in January " width=980 height=1372 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/what-to-do-in-the-garden-in-january-hellebore-1641565317.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-o6q7mr e6iqukd2">Ade Sellars</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Before hellebores open their flowers, cut away the leaves. Not only will it highlight their blooms, but old foliage can look unattractive and potentially have hellebore leaf spot.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Winter pansies may now be struggling to look their best, and will need a helping hand to prevent them from going to seed. Prune regular, removing any fading blooms.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">9. Winter wildlife</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Ensure bird-feeding stations are regularly topped up, and water supplies are fresh and not left to freeze. If you have a frozen fish pond avoid smashing the ice, as this can shock or even kill the fish. Instead, try to melt the ice gently with hot water. Don’t worry about harming the fish, as they tend to remain at the bottom of the pond during the winter.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h3 css-14uq8j5 et3p2gv0">10. Houseplants</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">With festive plants such as poinsettias, amaryllis, and early blooming hyacinths now looking past their best, this is an ideal time to introduce a new range of indoor plants to your home. Whether it’s a trendy succulent or a refined orchid for the bathroom, there are endless options for the indoor home-grower. Could this be the year you bring the outside in?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursZyew6q6xmeaqKVfqrhwtM6mnKxlmaPBpr7IqKmsZ5eWv6Wxzaxmmmtoa4N1hJdvZrCgkal6tbuMnaZmoZ5iwamxjKCYq5yVo3qquoyjmKetkafGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meaning-of-shadow-on-the-house-by-madness.html><span>←</span><span>Meaning of Shadow On The House by Madness</span></a>
