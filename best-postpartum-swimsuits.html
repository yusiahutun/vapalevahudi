Getting back into a swimsuit post-baby was a mixed bag of feelings for me. I went through it twice and had a completely different experience each time. After my first baby, I spent the last month of my maternity leave on the beach in Mexico, so I was in a bikini within two months of giving birth. Although now I would be high-fiving myself for that feat, at the time, I didn’t think anything of it."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I went through it twice and had a completely different experience each time. After my first baby, I spent the last month of my maternity leave on the beach in Mexico, so I was in a bikini within two months of giving birth. Although now I would be high-fiving myself for that feat, at the time, I didn’t think anything of it. I was a magazine editor, and it seemed like everyone around me who’d recently had a baby bounced right back into their pencil skirts—I was living in a fashion bubble.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fast-forward two years later, I had my second baby, and my body didn’t respond the same way at all, which was confusing to process, since I was expecting a repeat performance. By this point, I was living in California and had a pool, so I was back in a swimsuit right away again—but this time in a one-piece, which is still my go-to two years later.</p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, it’s important to be patient and kind to yourself. You did birth humans, after all, and should realize that comparing your body to anyone else’s is counterproductive. Instead of trying to force yourself into your pre-baby clothing lifestyle, it’s better to focus on finding things that make you look and feel good now. And, truth be told, I’m in a different place in my life, and few are the days of overanalyzing myself in a swimsuit. I’m too busy chasing my wild kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWisopq7pb%2BOoGpra2BqhHOEjpucrKxdpby0wM%2Baqa2tnWLAuLXMrKyirKNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./14-surprising-facts-about-planckendael.html><span>←</span><span>14 Surprising Facts About Planckendael</span></a>
