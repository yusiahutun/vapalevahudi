When it ended, she flew home to Paris, quit her job, and relocated to the UK to study 3D design full time, supporting herself by teaching French and selling jewelry on the side. "I made a few jewelry pieces while I was studying, and whenever I was wearing them, people would ask where I bought them. So I made a few pieces for friends—it was a 'fake it till you make it' kind of situation."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And made it she has. Eleven years on, Kermiche is a household name in the fashion world, and we'd be shocked if you haven't seen her eclectic jewelry on some of the world's most stylish women, or her famous "butt vases" adorning their shelves.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Style Files with Anissa Kermiche" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/ab460d45-72c6-441d-9245-8ed8cc40e3fe/thumb_1920x1080_00001_1709319780_47297.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kermiche's stunning London showroom recently hosted a celebration of the launch of <a href=# title="https://us.christianlouboutin.com/discover-the-loubi54-collection?utm_medium=publisher&utm_source=harpersbazaar&utm_campaign=loubi54-awareness-article" name=undefined data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://us.christianlouboutin.com/discover-the-loubi54-collection?utm_medium=publisher&utm_source=harpersbazaar&utm_campaign=loubi54-awareness-article" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Loubi54 class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Loubi54</a>, <a href=# title="https://us.christianlouboutin.com/?utm_medium=publisher&utm_source=harpersbazaar&utm_campaign=loubi54-awareness-article" name=undefined data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://us.christianlouboutin.com/?utm_medium=publisher&utm_source=harpersbazaar&utm_campaign=loubi54-awareness-article" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christian Louboutin's" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Christian Louboutin's</a> popular evening clutch, which has recently been reimagined in a crossbody style in a slate of stunning colors. It's a fitting pairing, as glamorous accents like the Loubi54 crossbody are exactly the kind of pieces you'll find working overtime in Kermiche's own wardrobe.</p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-02-09-harpers-anissa2610-65e229f824e4d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Louboutin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My clothing is very minimal—I love jeans, a well-cut T-shirt, a blazer," she says. "So I rely a lot on accessories to bring the personality. They're like the finishing touch, the lacquer. I like quite daring, colorful bags—they steal the show. You can show up with a simple black dress and an almost bare face, carrying a beautiful vivid bag, and it just makes the whole thing look so stylish and well thought through."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I love the size of the Loubi54—it's a bag that can follow you through your life."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=1000 height=667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-02-09-harpers-anissa2521-65e22b0e9941e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Louboutin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That said, Kermiche rarely sacrifices function for form. "I don't understand this trend of the mini-mini bags, because it's just not comfortable. And what's not comfortable is not empowering," she explains. "I love the size of the Loubi54—it's a bag that can follow you through your life. When you can keep a little book, a mirror, a bit of makeup in your bag, then it becomes your best companion."</p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-02-09-harpers-anissa2425-65e2329a3f959.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Louboutin</span></p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-02-09-harpers-anissa0021-65e232a8335d5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Louboutin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Combining sophistication and practicality, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://us.christianlouboutin.com/discover-the-loubi54-collection?utm_medium=publisher&utm_source=harpersbazaar&utm_campaign=loubi54-awareness-article" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Loubi54 line" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Loubi54 line</u></a> pays homage to the iconic New York nightclub era of the 1970s, as well as its Parisian counterparts where Christian Louboutin used to go with his friends. Kermiche was unsurprised to learn that the iconic French designer often draws from this period for inspiration. "It's an era that has had a really strong influence on how women in France dress to this day," she says.</p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-02-09-harpers-anissa2404-65e22eb65b613.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Louboutin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Paris-born Kermiche's personal style is a glamorous blend of influences from her hometown and London, the city she now calls home. She's certainly got a refreshing honesty on what it really takes to look so chic. "I don't really care about looking effortless," she says with charming sincerity. "This whole obsession about looking like you didn't try—I think it's quite rude, actually. I like people to think I made an effort for them and for myself."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whether it's through her hair, her handbag, or her perfectly lacquered nails—"not a very French thing to do, by the way"—having feminine, fun details are important to her. "Even if it's something like a gemstone on the nail, I'm not afraid of doing something that might be seen as tacky or high-maintenance."</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I'm not saying every woman has to be sexy—but if she wants to, no one should find that less chic."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you've seen Kermiche's designs, you'll know she loves to pay homage to the female form in all its natural glory. It's a philosophy that carries over into her wardrobe. "I prefer to celebrate femininity and all its splendor and shape," she says. "I'm not saying every woman has to be sexy or sexualized—but if she wants to, no one should find that less chic."</p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=1000 height=667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-02-09-harpers-anissa3651-65e22fc2de5ee.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Louboutin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It comes as no surprise, then, that Kermiche has plenty of pieces from Christian Louboutin—long lauded as one of the sexiest designer brands out there. "The classic point pumps are really sexy," she says. "I remember when they first came out, I would wear them with a mini and bare legs. They really allowed women to express their sexiness." These days, she's more partial to shoes that keep her a bit closer to the ground. "I love a Mary Jane—I have an extended collection of them, including the Louboutin Jane shoe. I think they suit pretty much every woman and go with anything: jeans, miniskirts, dresses."</p><img alt="This is an image" title="This is an image" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2024-02-09-harpers-anissa4715-65e230a98080e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Louboutin</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That's because for Kermiche, comfort is paramount. Quality over quantity ("I don't follow trends") and dressing for one's body are her other pillars of personal style: "Not everything suits everyone. I think it's really important to understand your body shape and move toward pieces that make you feel good, instead of looking at what other people are wearing. Because by being comfortable, you'll go more places, do more things, and feel more empowered."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shop the new <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://us.christianlouboutin.com/discover-the-loubi54-collection?utm_medium=publisher&utm_source=harpersbazaar&utm_campaign=loubi54-awareness-article" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Loubi54 crossbody silhouette" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Loubi54 crossbody silhouette</u></a> and the iconic designer's full array of handbags, shoes, and accessories from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://us.christianlouboutin.com/?utm_medium=publisher&utm_source=harpersbazaar&utm_campaign=loubi54-awareness-article" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=christianlouboutin.com class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>christianlouboutin.com</u></a> today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiZZmV9dYKXa25oopWssq2%2B2GarrqqemrFutM6mnLCZoprAbrDErKCgppWneqK6yKyqmmWbmr%2ButcKhnGacn5rAr8CMnJirnV2Wr7DB02ajqKebnruoecSfnaiqpKGytL%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daughter-17-jp-morgan-chase-investment-banker-jumped-death-luxury-apartment-html.html><span>←</span><span>Daughter, 17, of JP Morgan Chase investment banker jumped to her death from luxury apartment</span></a>
