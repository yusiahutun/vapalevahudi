But she didn’t let the teasing bother her, and she happily showed off her beautiful baby bump at events. Back in May, the actress was looking radiant and beautiful at the event where <a href=#>DAYS</a> co-creator and producer Ken Corday was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async width=683 height=1024 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/nadia-bjorlin-baby-bump.jpg alt="Nadia Bjorlin Baby Bump - Getty" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=text-align:center>(Photo Credit: Gabriel Olsen/WireImage)</p><p>In March, Bjorlin revealed the news of her new pregnancy on Instagram with an adorable photo of her 15-month-old son, Torin, wearing a “World’s Greatest Brother” shirt. “Torin the Chief excited about his upcoming role of big brother,” she wrote. “Baby Bull #2 debuting August 2017!”</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>#TorinTheChief excited about his upcoming role of big brother!

While in her third trimester, Bjorlin was more than ready to welcome her baby into the world. “I watched my kid eat dog food off the floor this morning, but I’m too tired to care,” she tweeted back in July. “Happy Friday!”</p><p>Bjorlin returned to DAYS full-time in June of 2016, while still pregnant with Torin, but her maternity leave didn’t impact Chloe’s story too dramatically. And it looks like the same will hold true for this pregnancy, which the soap is not writing in. “That’s why I’m desperately clutching large handbags on the show!” she joked on Twitter.</p><p>This article originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=#>CBS Soaps in Depth</a>.</p><p><strong>We expect “Baby Bull #2” to be just as beautiful as Torin —&nbsp;you can see just how much Viggo looks like his big brother in the family photo gallery below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfnK6tuMSrsGidnqmys8DAoqWmnZ6pfK%2Btw6KYZpqapL%2Bttc1mmZqaqWKvsMWMqZ%2BorJ%2BoenKBlmpsbg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./royal-family-garrard-jewellery-true-stories.html><span>←</span><span>The history of the Royal Family's jewellery: an interview with Garrard</span></a>
