So, when actress <a href=#>Jenna Fischer</a> (aka Pam) wrote about her on-screen love story with co-star <a href=#>John Krasinski</a> (aka Jim) in her new book, [The Actor’s Life: A Survival Guide](<a href=#>https://www.amazon.com/Actors-Life-Survival-Guide/dp/1944648224/ref=sr</a>11?ie=UTF8&qid=1510676486&sr=8-1&keywords=the+actor%27s+life+a+survival+guide&tag=cosmopolitanauto-append-20&ascsubtag=[artid|10049.a.13592683[src|)_, we couldn’t get enough of her sweet stories!</p><p>In one chapter, Jenna, 43, remembered filming Jim and Pam’s first kiss in “The Dundies” Season 2 episode and revealed the cast and crew thought the moment was “perfect.” She wrote, “When he walked away, I felt completely transported into a new reality. I was Pam, I was talking with my mother, and my heart was breaking. I spoke into the phone, telling her I was in love with Jim, but I couldn’t confess my feelings to him. Suddenly, Jim walked in the door. I turned and saw him and my heart felt like it might burst out of my chest. I wanted so much to tell him how I felt, but before I could, he kissed me. It was perfect.” How adorable is that?!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jenna-fischer-the-office.jpg><p>(Photo Credit: Getty Images)</p><p>Jenna also recalled auditioning for The Office and gave details about the first time she chatted with John, 38. “[He] wasn’t just the best Jim — he was Jim. I remember the day we met. As I was being shown to the actor’s holding room, he was just being called in to read with another potential Pam… As he passed by, he introduced himself, and we shook hands. It was if lightning struck through the center of the room,” she wrote.</p><p>“John and I were walking out of an audition scene, and he suddenly turned to me and whispered, ‘You’re my favorite Pam. I hope you get this job,'” Jenna wrote. “It was exactly as sweet and cute and supportive as anything Jim would say to Pam. I smiled really big and said, ‘I’m so glad you said that because you’re my favorite Jim and I don’t think anyone could do it except for you.'” Have you ever read anything sweeter?! We miss these two together on the small screen so much!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jnKemkWKzqr%2FCoZyrZZqkta95yquYrKGeqLiqedOhnGanlpu2pLGMamtvcGFofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./classic-american-films-shawshank-redemption-10-best-lines-1994.html><span>←</span><span>Classic American films: The Shawshank Redemption the 10 best lines from 1994 prison drama</span></a>
