It offers photographers a huge 50 percent royalty payment on each photo sold. The site also allows photographers to sell their photos elsewhere, but you'll only get 40 percent commission for those.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>This has enabled Alamy to become the world's largest marketplace for stock photos, with a huge number of monthly visitors---all of whom are potential customers for your photos.</p><h2 id=shutterstock>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shutterstock</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/shutterstock-sell-photos.png><p>Since launch, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Shutterstock</a> has paid out over $500 million to its contributors. When you upload a photo to the marketplace, you still keep the copyright. And you can earn up to 30 percent of the sale price of your photos depending on the size of your image. Currently, the payout starts at $0.25 and can go up to $120 for custom images.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=istock-photo>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iStock Photo</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/istock-sell-photos.png><p>If you're interested in learning about <a href=#>the best types of photos to sell online</a>, take a look at iStock Photo. Its popular forums and resources will help you to find your feet, and understand how to sell photos online.</p><p>You have to apply before you start selling your photos. The application process consists of submitting a few samples of your work through the Contributor by Getty Images app. Since iStock Photos and Getty Images are partners, you may get accepted into either platform.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The site doesn't provide any specifics about how much you can get paid, but states that you'll earn a percentage off of every photo that you sell.</p><h2 id=photoshelter>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PhotoShelter</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/photoshelter-sell-photos.png><p>If you want to sell your photos online, but would rather make those sales through your own site, PhotoShelter is a fantastic tool for this.</p><p>At its core, it's a photography-oriented eCommerce platform that you can integrate into almost any website. This includes cloud storage for your photos, a built-in shopping cart, drag-and-drop website templates, an intuitive interface, decent SEO (search engine optimization), and several social media integrations.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The benefits of this option include retaining full control over how your photos are displayed, not having your competitors photos displayed alongside your own, and the ability to earn much more of the sale price.</p><p>Unfortunately, you will have to pay a subscription fee for this service. The basic plan starts at $10/month and comes with the minimum amount of features.</p><h2 id=adobe-stock>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Stock</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/adobestock-sell-photos.png><p>Adobe Stock is a beautiful site that offers a royalty of 33 percent for photos and 35 percent for vector art. You can deposit these royalties into your bank account after you've reached a threshold of $25. Adobe Stock is integrated into Adobe's apps, making it more likely your photo will get noticed.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Adobe has simplified the way you upload your photos. Instead of going through the painstakingly slow process of tagging all of your images, Adobe's smart tagging system does it for you. To make your life even easier, Adobe allows you to upload your photos through Adobe Lightroom CC, Adobe Bridge CC, or its website.</p><h2 id=smugmug>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SmugMug</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/smugmug-sell-photos.png><p>The SmugMug Pro package is an alternative to PhotoShelter. The platform enables you to showcase your work on a massively customizable storefront, and to manage your orders for a yearly subscription fee.</p><p>The main distinguishing feature is the ability to use SmugMug's printing service create prints, books, and greetings cards from your snapshots. There are also some additional features such as the ability to create coupons, photo packages, and built-in analytics. You'll also get to keep up to 85 percent of your revenue.</p><h2 id=can-stock-photo>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Can Stock Photo</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/canstock-sell-photos.png><p>If you're looking for an easy way to sell your photos online, Can Stock Photo is a viable option. After you submit three images to the site's editors, you'll need to wait 24 hours for approval to start selling.</p><p>When uploading photos onto the site, Can Stock Photo will also post your work to one of the largest stock image databases, Fotosearch. You can earn up to 50 percent in royalties on the site, and can withdraw your money into PayPal once your balance reaches $50. If you want a mailed check, you'll have to wait until you have earned $100.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=123rf>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">123RF</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/123rtf-sell-photos.png><p>This site has over 110 million files on offer, with almost 100,000 more added every day. The royalties payable vary between 30 percent and 60 percent depending on your level of contribution. This means that the more photos you upload, the higher your payout.</p><p>If you upload less than 999 images to the site, you'll earn 30 percent, which equates to $0.216 per download. If you upload over 1 million images, you'll receive 60 percent, which equates to $0.432 per download.</p><h2 id=dreamstime>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreamstime</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dreamstime-sell-photos.png><p>In the stock photography world, Dreamstime is a reputable player. It achieved this status by ensuring that all uploads are reviewed to check they meet their high standards, thereby guaranteeing quality.</p><p>Once your photos are approved, you'll receive royalties of 25-50 percent. However, this could increase to 60 percent on all images if you sign an exclusivity contract. If you do sign that exclusivity deal, you'll also receive an additional bonus of $0.20 for your first 100 approved submissions.</p><h2 id=fineartamerica>10. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FineArtAmerica</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fineartamerica-sell-photos.png><p>FineArtAmerica is the perfect place to set up an alluring portfolio, and to sell physical prints of your shots. You can sell each photo as a canvas print, poster, framed print, metal print, acrylic print, greeting card, phone case, and more.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>When you make a sale, the order (including the printing) can be fulfilled by the company's own printing service. You'll have to pay the base price for the production, but you can make a profit by raising the price of the final product.</p><p>In other words, if a canvas print costs $50 for FineArtAmerica to produce, you can increase the price to $75---that way, you'll earn $25 from an order.</p><p>If you're able to <a href=#>print your own digital photos online</a>, you might want to sell pictures on a craft site like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Etsy</a>&nbsp;instead.</p><h2 id=snapped4u>11. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snapped4U</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/snapped4u-sell-photos.png><p>If you're a photographer who takes photos at events---parties, gigs, festivals, weddings---you should know that Snapped4U allows you to easily sell these pictures online.

If the photo is sold at more than $5, Snapped4U will charge a 10 percent commission.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=fotomoto>12. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fotomoto</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fotomoto-sell-photos.jpg><p>For photographers who already have a website, but want to sell physical prints, Fotomoto is the way to go.
