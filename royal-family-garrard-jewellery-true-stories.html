In 1843, Queen Victoria decided to appoint Garrard as the first official crown jeweller, a position the brand held until 2007. These days, Mark Appleby, the head of Mappin & Webb's jewellery workshop, has been the crown jeweller since 2017, but Garrard still has a very close friendship with the royal family: Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice wore the brand to the recent coronation, for example.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I guess it’s difficult to say what Garrard would have been without that relationship – it’s definitely been defining for us,” says Scott. “Although we have other celebrities who wear our pieces, for years the royals have been the most influential trendsetters; people would look to them for their tastes and follow them.”</p><img alt="duchess of cambridge at the state banquet" title="Duchess of Cambridge at the State Banquet" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-tiara-state-banquet-1544001559.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">WPA Pool</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The Princess of Wales, wearing the Lover’s Knot Tiara once favoured by Princess Diana</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the 164 years that Garrard acted as the crown jeweller, the company were responsible for “making crowns, altering sceptres, engagement rings, tiaras, all sorts of things,” reveals Prentice. There’s the Lover’s Knot Tiara, made by Garrard, which used to be favoured by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/entertainment/a35115516/the-crown-princess-diana-motherhood/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess Diana" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Princess Diana</a> and is now often worn by the current <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/style-files/news/g30338/duchess-of-cambridge-best-style-fashion-moments/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Princess of Wales" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Princess of Wales</a>, and the Girls Of Great Britain And Ireland Tiara, a piece much-loved by the late Queen Elizabeth II. She also had a particular soft spot for the Fringe Tiara, once Queen Mary’s, which she wore for her wedding day.</p><img alt="queen elizabeth ii" title="Queen Elizabeth II" width=1888 height=2743 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-52116831-64198c5b66da5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tim Graham</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Queen Elizabeth II wearing The Girls Of Great Britain And Ireland Tiara</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Oh, we love that story,” laughs Scott. “The Fringe Tiara is actually transformable, like a lot of Garrard tiaras: the piece comes entirely off the frame, so it can also be worn as a necklace. The frame itself was probably quite old, and when it was placed in the princess’ hair by her hairdresser, it snapped. Garrard was sent to the palace by police escort, the tiara was brought to the workshop and someone did a super quick fix on it. Apparently, the Queen Mother said to her: ‘We’ve got lots of tiaras, dear, why don’t you just pick another one?’ But she was adamant she wanted to wear the Fringe Tiara on her wedding day. We like to look at the pictures, and see if we can spot that it’s been quickly mended!” Happily, the tiara was fully restored and is now worn by other royals, including Camilla, our new Queen Consort, and Princess Beatrice, on her own wedding day.</p><img alt="20th november 1947 princess elizabeth leaving westminster abbey, after her wedding to the prince philip, duke of edinburgh photo by topical press agencygetty images" title="Queen Elizabeth II wearing the Fringe Tiara on her wedding day in 1947﻿" width=2512 height=3378 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-3326204-645532001b54e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Topical Press Agency</span><p>Queen Elizabeth II wearing the Fringe Tiara on her wedding day in 1947</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Perhaps the most important moment the pair can recall in Garrard’s royal history, however, is a certain sapphire and diamond ring that went on to become one of the most famous pieces of jewellery of all time, when Princess Diana chose it as her engagement ring in 1981. “A lot of commissions that happened over the years included stones that belonged to the crown, that were then put into Garrard designs,” says Scott. “Queen Mary was probably one of the most prolific collectors of our life, and a lot of the stones were hers. But Diana’s ring wasn’t bespoke, and that made it really significant.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I was speaking recently to someone I knew, who worked in the Regent Street flagship branch at the time,” says Prentice. “Part of this gentleman’s role was, every morning, to prepare the high-jewellery room with all the jewellery from the safe. That particular morning, he noticed there were quite a few items missing. There was a bit of a buzz, because everyone knew that this proposal might go ahead, and that the crown jeweller had taken some pieces. He came back minus the sapphire and diamond ring, so they guessed that was the one she had chosen.”</p><img alt="file photo in this photo composite image a comparison has been made between the engagement announcements of prince charles, prince of wales and lady diana spencer and prince william to catherine middletonleft image london, united kingdom february 24 prince charles arm in arm with his fiance, lady diana spencer, on the steps of buckingham palace for a photocall on the day they announced their engagement photo by tim graham photo library via getty images right image london, england november 16 prince william and kate middleton pose for photographs in the state apartments of st james palace on november 16, 2010 in london, england after much speculation, clarence house today announced the engagement of prince william to kate middleton the couple will get married in either the spring or summer of next year and continue to live in north wales while prince william works as an air sea rescue pilot for the raf the couple became engaged during a recent holiday in kenya having been together for eight years photo by chris jacksongetty images" title="Royal Wedding Comparison - Engagement Photos" width=4294 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-113726072-6455325390b68.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tim Graham</span><p>Princess Diana and, later, Kate Middleton, wearing the sapphire and diamond engagement ring Diana chose from Garrard</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think you could say that was a pivotal moment for us,” Prentice continues. “It’s tradition that the ring is chosen for the fiancée; the fact that Diana chose her own meant the ring became synonymous with Garrard.” Now, the ring is worn by the current Princess of Wales, and jewellers have seen an increase in sales for engagement rings featuring coloured stones due to its popularity. Garrard’s ‘1735’ ring, which is based on the design, is available with a variety of different stones, from emeralds to rubies and aquamarines. It’s a best-seller for the brand, and “we have a big peak in interest [for that style], especially in the US, whenever anything royal is happening,” says Scott. “Even when <a href=#

class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The relationship between Garrard and the royals informs the brand’s design processes, even today. “For Sarah and me, it’s an incredible heritage to draw from,” says Scott. “Rather than making direct copies of styles and tastes from the past, the inspiration behind old pieces can give us the feeling for new collections.” The Blaze collection, for example, takes Diana as its muse, along with “the way she approached life: she was very strong-willed, with an amazing character and personality,” explains Prentice. “We took the design of her engagement ring and inverted it, which created a harmonious cluster of stones.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Aloria collection, meanwhile, is inspired by the setting of the Cullinan One diamond in the Sovereign Sceptre, “which is quite distinctive – almost an open heart shape,” says Scott. “it’s become something of a design language for Garrard.” They’ve even designed a limited-edition Aloria pendant and earrings, available to buy now, in celebration of this year's coronation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Our discussion has come back to the main event, at which both Prentice and Scott were excited to see plenty of Garrard jewellery in action – particularly the more impressive pieces from the brand’s history. “I was just glad to see some <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/jewellery-watches/a39606841/tiaras/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink
