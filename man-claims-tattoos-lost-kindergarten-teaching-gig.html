A man in France claims he was prevented from teaching kindergarten because his heavily tattooed body may have frightened some of the students.
Covered in ink from head to toe, Sylvain Helaine -- who also had the whites of his eyes turned black through surgery -- said authorities at Docteur Morere Elementary School in Palaiseau told him he was not allowed to teach children under six after the parents of a three-year-old complained his appearance caused their child to have nightmares."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

"Getting tattoos is my passion," he explained.</p><p>And he hopes his students will learn to be more tolerant of people who are different than the status quo.</p><p>"Maybe when they are adults they will be less racist and less homophobic and more open-minded," he said.</p><p><strong>Got a story or a tip for us?
