For the last two months, the threat to my employer, the Mississippi Bend AEA, has been made very clear. It convinced me that I needed to take action in a way that could have an impact beyond just being a volunteer. I decided that my background and commitment to democracy most fit with the work of the auditor and elections administrator.”</p><p>The auditor’s work concerns the most basic responsibility and function of a healthy democracy: The freedom and right to vote and ensuring that all voters have their voices heard, he said.</p><p>“Our current auditor has landed our county in the news several times for their mishandling of our elections,” he said. “It’s clear that the current auditor lacks the leadership and understanding of the responsibilities of this office and it is concerning,” he said. “Our elections should be trustworthy, not newsworthy. I will restore transparency, competence and professionalism to the leadership of the auditor’s office and the administration of our elections.”</p><p>For more information, visit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://trimbleforauditor.com>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKuroZ2XuaZ5wKelqK2emLK0ecKapZ2hlJawunnFqKlmq5OkwbV5wqisp6ypYq62sMitpqtn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./snooki-halloween-costume-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Snooki Does Halloween with Lorenzo, Jionni &amp;amp; Baby Giovanna -- See Their Turtle Costumes!</span></a>
