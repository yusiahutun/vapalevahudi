So when VB announced the release of a new series of purses dubbed "the royally approved clutch", we took notice. You may remember back in March 2019, Meghan wore a Victoria Beckham dress to attend the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey with <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a>.</strong> She accessorised the white mid-length dress with chain motifs with one of Victoria's green 'Satin Pocket Clutch' bags – and it's now been given a leather makeover!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b5fd909ce279-meghan-markle-victoria-beckham-bag-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=elqdEhG4v134 data-wc=10><strong>Meghan wore Victoria's green Satin Pocket Clutch earlier this year</strong></p><p id=ezhxfwBV5Vuo data-wc=88>The vintage-inspired design loved by Meghan has been revamped for autumn/winter and instead of satin, the 'Pocket Clutch' has been made with soft lamb nappa leather. It has a frame design that is easy to open and fold and is perfectly sized to function as a party bag for day or an evening clutch. Priced at £350, it comes in four colours; bordeaux, green, orange, and emerald. We expect it won't be long before we see it on the Duchess' arm so you'd better snap one up fast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0975d1e8fb11-victoria-beckham-clutch-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=emYty02oOFRx data-wc=4>Victoria Beckham's <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Pocket Clutch</a>, £350</p><p id=evXDOuLaE72u data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham swears by THIS £10 skincare product – and you can buy it at Boots</a></strong></p><p id=eBLB5WzA8FOJ data-wc=74>Of course, Meghan has rocked arm candy by VB before. On Christmas Day in 2018, she almost broke the internet when she was spotted with Victoria's 'Powder Box bag'. The structured box bag was made in a curved shape and was actually inspired by a vanity powder box. So much so, it even has a mirror in the lid. Trimmed with leather, it has a matching circular gold grooved clasp and a wide handle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/210521543ddd-meghan-markle-vb-bag-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e-pjsH-_fJ2e data-wc=11><strong>Meghan carried the Powder Box bag by Victoria Beckham in 2018</strong></p><p id=eRlSdZZqRj44 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong>&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The regal tattoo! 8 royals who have surprised us with their body art</a></p><p id=eM1ilc7tZXRS data-wc=56>The bag sold out as soon as Meghan was snapped in it, but now - you can finally get your mitts on one - for £1550. What's more, the former Spice Girl has given it a new update too, it's now available in satin, but you had better be quick as there's only limited stock available.</p><p id=ez0AFMAPggkZ data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm660tMiopWhqYGaGcnyPcW5xcGJnfLe1wq2mq6GRYq%2Bmr8qhmKZloqTGorjLsmSaqKCnvLexw2anqJubmsFur8uuq5ygXaKyqLTAp2SmmaKguaZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ultra-publishing-inks-deal-with-acclaimed-hip-hop-producer-wheezy.html><span>←</span><span>Ultra Publishing Inks Deal With Acclaimed Hip-Hop Producer Wheezy</span></a>
