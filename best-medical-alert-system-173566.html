<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>The Best Medical Alert System: Freedom Guardian Review</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>As we <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">age</a>, staying on top of our <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">health</a> becomes of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, it’s not always possible to do it alone — or to be there to help our aging friends and family members. Enter medical alert systems. These life-saving devices, once activated, can connect you directly to an expert who has access to your medical background and can act as your first line of defense in the event of an emergency. As these systems are largely built for function — not fashion — most aren’t exactly stylish. We found one that won’t cramp anyone’s style, however, since it’s designed to look just like your <a href=# rel="dofollow noopener noreferrer">favorite smartwatch</a>: the <strong>Medical Guardian Freedom Guardian (</strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>$99, Medical Guardian</strong></a><strong>).&nbsp;</strong></p><p>At first glance, this device looks just like any other high-tech timepiece on the market today. It’s equipped with a sizable, easy-to-read display screen with digital time and a comfort fit wristband, plus advanced GPS location tracking and text-to-speech messaging that will allow you to verbally respond to messages — just like you would on an Apple Watch.</p><p>The Freedom Guardian has a few added extras, though, that make it ideal for seniors or anyone that’s concerned about their wellbeing. For starters, there’s a daily reminder function for those who forget to take their medications. More importantly, for an added <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$44.95 a month</a>, you can link your device to MedicalGuardian’s 24/7 emergency and non-emergency monitor center, giving you or your loved one access to emergency services should they be needed.&nbsp;</p><p>The monthly fee also allows for friends and family members to use an accompanying companion app, called Care Circle, that will help keep an eye on loved ones while they’re on-the-go. With this app, you can track a wearer’s location or help to virtually organize their daily routines. You’ll &nbsp;also receive updates when alerts are triggered, making this watch as useful of a tool for the users’ close acquaintances as it is for the wearer.&nbsp;</p><p>Each new user will receive one free month of service with purchase, and it’s free to activate, with no pesky contracts required.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/medical-guardian-medical-alert-system.png><p>Users are raving about this device, with one writing, “I love that this product … looks like a normal smartwatch so people don’t even know it’s actually a Medical Guardian device. It’s great for active seniors or for people who are at risk. It gives me peace of mind and it’s so easy to use!”</p><p>Wrote one happy family member: “I got this watch for my father … and he was a little skeptical about it at first, but he loves it! He can respond to text messages, schedule appointments, and a few other things right on his wrist. The screen size is great and I love that in time of crisis, his watch will have his back when I can’t! Very satisfied with my purchase.”</p><p><strong>Where to buy: </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>$99, Medical Guardian</strong></a></p><p>See more of our <a href=#><strong>best product recommendations</strong></a>.</p><p>We write about products we think our readers will like.
