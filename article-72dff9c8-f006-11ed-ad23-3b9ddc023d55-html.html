She is the oldest of four children, including her beloved brothers Don Greco, Gathian Greco (Sara) and Byron Greco. Carolyn was a loving mother to her four children, Dawn Koerner (Ron), Marty Hester (Sherra), Jill Franklin (Josh) and Laura Picard (John-Michael). She was blessed with seven grandchildren, Caroline Hill, Hannah Hester, Bruce Greco Hill, Reese Picard, Macie Picard, Scarlett Franklin and River Franklin<span>,</span> <span>who affectionately called her “B.” Carolyn adored all of her extended family and had a</span> very special place in her heart for her nephews Joe and Tony Greco. Carolyn's radiant presence, joyful spirit, and graciousness touched the lives of all who had the privilege of knowing her.</p><p>Carolyn's unwavering love and commitment were evident in her role as a devoted wife of 38 years to her beloved husband David Wiatrolik.
