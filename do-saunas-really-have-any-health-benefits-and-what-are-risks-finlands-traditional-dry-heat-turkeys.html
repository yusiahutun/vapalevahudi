From Finlands traditional d</h1></header><section class=post-content><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the core of the sauna experience is the interplay between heat, the human body and the mind. “For centuries, saunas have been used to aid in recovery,” says QC NY Spa’s Simona Sbarbaro.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/be69d8b4-9059-4c2d-ac53-357227688476_c14ecd05.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As soon as we enter a sauna, the heat begins its work, penetrating the skin and elevating the body’s core temperature. This thermal stress triggers a flood of physiological responses designed to cool down the body, which have been noticed and celebrated since the days of ancient Rome. “Salus per aquam – or health through water – is the tradition of ancient thermal baths in Rome, which were communal places that entrusted water with the care of physical well-being and the regeneration of the soul,” Sbarbaro explains.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What’s all the noise about sound bathing, and does it work?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dr Elisabeth Ixmeier, co-founder and COO of Healing Hotels of the World, says that, in the short term, regular sauna use can help reduce stress, promote relaxation, help lower blood pressure and improve blood flow, adding, “It can also be a great tool to help relieve muscle soreness and joint pain, improve skin hydration and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.” In addition to these short-term advantages, several long-term health benefits are linked to regular sauna use, she adds, including a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and respiratory disease.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These health benefits are primarily attributed to increased blood flow to the skin, a natural response aimed at cooling the body through sweating. This process not only enhances circulation, delivering more oxygen and nutrients to tissues and aiding in removing waste, but also boosts overall cardiovascular health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/290cf05b-bdf8-4174-8dc6-14f23592b889_4c0589f6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Moreover, the improved blood flow eases muscle tension, relieving soreness and stiffness – making it particularly beneficial for athletes and individuals with conditions like arthritis or fibromyalgia – by easing discomfort and enhancing mobility. Additionally, sauna-induced sweating plays a key role in detoxification, expelling toxins such as heavy metals and supporting the body’s natural purification processes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This detoxification process is complemented by the sauna’s ability to induce a state of mild hyperthermia, boosting the immune system’s function and enhancing the body’s natural healing processes.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Move over, K-beauty – Ayurvedic skincare is 2024’s beauty trend to know</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On top of the touted long-term health benefits, sweating in a sauna can help unclog pores, flush out impurities and toxins, and remove dead skin cells, leading to clearer, more radiant skin. Moreover, the increased blood flow to the skin’s surface can promote cellular renewal and collagen production, potentially reducing the appearance of wrinkles and improving skin elasticity over time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Traditional Finnish saunas, which use dry heat, are the most common type of sauna. They work by heating the air around you, which in turn heats your body,” Ixmeier explains. They also operate at a higher temperatures, typically of 70 to 90 degrees Celsius, making them more immediately effective at offering benefits to cardiovascular health, reducing stress and relieving muscle soreness and joint pain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/fa220d72-7509-44bd-b55c-91cc31931802_741ac6ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Steam rooms – more popular in Sweden – by contrast, operate at a lower temperature, but create almost 100 per cent humidity, creating a warm, misty environment that is gentle on the respiratory system. “Traditional Finnish saunas appear to be the most well-studied and have been associated with several benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, pain relief and reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia,” adds Ixmeier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Modern infrared saunas mark a significant departure from tradition, employing infrared panels that emit light to warm muscles and tissues beneath the skin directly. This method enables heating at lower temperatures, offering a more comfortable experience for those sensitive to the heat or air quality, and is often touted as being more effective than traditional saunas at detoxifying the body and improving skin health.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But no matter one’s sauna’s preference, taking a sauna, even regularly, is not a miracle cure, and it’s of course vital to be consistent and to couple saunas with healthy habits and lifestyle. “While saunas certainly provide valuable short-term benefits, it is only a stepping stone in achieving wellness,” Sbarbaro says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/04/17/8df76741-41c4-41aa-9aab-9a46762717e8_4dfbd792.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It may be no surprise that today nearly all Finns have saunas in their homes, with a mix of modern electric and traditional wood-burning set-ups, and many partake in the ritual several times a week. However, all that heat can also present potential concerns for skin health, particularly for those with sensitive skin or conditions such as rosacea, eczema or psoriasis. That’s why Sbarbaro suggests considering some safety considerations and potential risks.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Gen Alpha beauty is on the rise – but how young is too young for a skincare routine?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Prolonged exposure to the high temperatures of saunas that exceed the recommended time can lead to dehydration or heat exhaustion, particularly for those with cardiovascular and respiratory conditions,” she says. Those who are pregnant should not partake in saunas at all, she adds, and “it’s crucial to stay hydrated, limit session durations, and exit the sauna if feeling lightheaded or dizzy”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ultimately, integrating sauna use into a healthy lifestyle is a personal journey that should be tailored to individual health needs and preferences, always erring on the side of caution. By doing so, sauna use can be a safe, enjoyable and beneficial practice that enhances well-being and supports a holistic approach to health.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZpudkarBunvWnqOlppWowHCt0a2gnKSVZIBzgZhrbm9nlKR6tK3Up5isZaKarq242Gafmq6VYq6vxYyhnJqkpJ16o7HNnp2irKNirq%2BwjLCfmqxdlr%2BmedGiqqSrXZu2r7jAp5usZaSnrqW106Kmp5mcYrGzxYyhnJqsXanCs7fEsqo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./breast-cancer-poem.html><span>←</span><span>Can Someone Wake Me?
