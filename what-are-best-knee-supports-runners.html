But a knee brace is a good tool to add support, allowing your to run during your recovery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There’s a range of products on offer, from large tubes that slip over your leg, to small bands around your knee, or even supporting tape.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We’ve listed a few below, but beware: if the symptoms persist, go to a physiotherapist or doctor to assess the underlying cause.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">IPOW 2</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This small support is strapped just below your knee cap and can be adjusted to fit your leg or preference of tightness. Runners with a range of issues say the IPOW worked for them. One reviewer said she had been using a lot of pain killers, but as soon as she put on the knee straps she was able to run two miles or even hike with a heavy pack. Another said he was able to run again, even though his cartilage had deteriorated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">UFlex Athletics Knee Compression Sleeve</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The UFlex contrasts the IPOW in that it covers the whole knee, and the area around it. It is lined with silicone on the inside to stop it from slipping as you run. It is a pretty simple design, without much too it aside from acting as extra compression to support the joint, but it does exactly what it says on the tin. Reviewers said it fit well, stayed in place and the compression aspect helped them run through various stages of knee pain, including excruciating pain, post surgery recovery runs and little niggles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">EXOUS Knee Brace</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This brace covers the whole knee and part of the leg, much like the UFlex, but it has adjustable Velcro straps to add more support. Users with a range of issues, such as a damaged meniscus and ACL reconstructions swore by the EXOUS. However, despite the adjustable straps, it was not for everyone. Some complained that it simply did not fit their leg, so it might be worth buying this one in a store, so you can try it on before you know if it’s right for you.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">KT Tape</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This disposable tape is a popular aid for joint support. The tape is elastic, so as you apply it to your skin, you can pull it to create tension and different levels of support. It’s great because you can tailor the tape each time you apply it to suit your needs and the extent of your injury. To get the most out of KT Tape, it is worth viewing a YouTube tutorial of where to apply it for your injury.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Vive Hinged Knee Brace</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The hinge brace is a bit more heavy duty than other knee supports, so is probably not best if you are heading out on a high-speed race. It is adjustable to fit your size and works with a combination of compression and the hinge taking pressure of your joint as it moves. the hinge can be removed as your knee gets stronger. Reviewers said it was great and their knee pain disappeared after a few hours of wearing it, in some cases.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqK2kmbywvo6gmJ2flanAbrPEmqlomaKptqS4xGhqaWtpboF2e9ahmK1lkaeybq7ErKtmo56asm6%2F1KmnqKqkqHqzwc2nnKur</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maple-deluxe-butcher-block.html><span>←</span><span>Maple Deluxe Butcher Block Laurel Mercantile</span></a>
