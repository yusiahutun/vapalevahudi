I was thinking, I’m going to have <a href=#>my residency</a>, I want to do something, but I wasn’t ready to have the big incisions or a face-lift,” the 57-year-old performer explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/paula-abdul-pic.jpg><p>In order to get exactly what she wanted, Paula went to a company that could give her the ageless face that she desired. “So I was trying to navigate and I found this company and they have this procedure that’s called Face Tight and Body Tight,” she said. “And what I loved about it is it’s minimally invasive. No noticeable scars. I was out walking around two or three days later.”</p><p>With much anticipation, Wendy interrupted Paula and asked, “What did you do?”</p><p>“OK, I’m getting there,” the “Forever Your Girl” singer replied. “Skin elasticity, I wanted a little sleeker jawline.”</p><p>Paula then gave Wendy a few more details about the procedure she got done. “Look. So it’s radio-frequency you can get numbed or if you’re a wimp like me they can give you an Ativan,” she explained.</p><p>However, the most surprising part about Paula’s new face was how long it took to get it all done. According to the former <a href=#>American Idol</a> judge, she said she was probably in the doctor’s office for maybe “less” than an hour. However, the details are a little fuzzy for her because she recalls being a tad bit “loopy” at the time.</p><p>“I remember being a little loopy,” she said about her reaction to the medicine her doctor gave her. “But what I love about it is there’s no visible scars, no big incisions.”</p><p>After Wendy took a closer look at Paula’s face she couldn’t deny that her friend’s work was done flawlessly. “I don’t see anything except for a flat neck,” she said, and Paula appeared to be very proud with the results.</p><p>Cosmetic procedure or not, you still look gorgeous, Paula!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pmK6kkWKuo7DUpWSspJGiwG68y5qqraGTYsC2vsaeqbJloqq6sL7SZqmerpWWubR5xZqanmWgp7ykscOuqZ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./renaissance-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>How to Slay it Under Budget</span></a>
