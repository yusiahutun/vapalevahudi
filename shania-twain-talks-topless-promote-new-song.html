"You have to be strong. I never really get angry with criticism," she admitted. "You can't please everybody, that's normal."</p><p>She also hinted at plans of a musical featuring her hit songs as well as a biopic that would detail her life story on the silver screen.</p><p>"Yes.

I'm writing songs all the time and the Netflix documentary ['Not Just A Girl'] has been a huge talking point in my life and career," she continued. "There's all sorts of things coming up but things I probably can't talk about right now. But I've got a very busy few years ahead of me."</p><p>The five-time Grammy Award winner also opened up about her sixth studio album and releasing her first single in five years, "Waking Up Dreaming."</p><p>Twain says she hopes to cheer people up with its release as it features "chirpy" music.</p><p>"I'm really excited about cheering people up," she explained of her new project which as of now is untitled. "This album is very chirpy and I'm very frank with my lyrics on it, so it's not a fluffy, lyrical album. It's a happy album."</p><p>"I had a very productive songwriting pandemic period and as much as we were isolated, it was almost like I wanted to cheer myself up, and that just came out in the music. It's so danceable."</p><a id=gallery-link-4ca7acbc-869c-4fbc-a428-ee1bddcf1b48 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4ca7acbc-869c-4fbc-a428-ee1bddcf1b48 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:e813fd66-13f4-4fa1-8878-766c816ceb46 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/71/4by3/2022/09/24/718ade2eb52045019456e8767b66e9d1_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3Jma25fqLWiusiaZK2vkZ67bsDApaKsZaSkva2x0qxkqaqfory1sYynnLBlo6S7qHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-deans-private-letters-girlfriend-barbara-glenn-sale-auction-html.html><span>←</span><span>James Dean's private letters to girlfriend Barbara Glenn are up for sale at auction</span></a>
