Her unwavering commitment to making a positive impact in the world has helped her become a great leader and a trusted partner for organizations seeking to achieve sustainable high-performance outcomes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Getting to know Christina</h3><p>Christina Foxwell is an avid reader with an impressive collection of books. Among them, she holds a special place in her heart for ‘The Gift: 14 Lessons to Save Your Life’ by Edith Eger. This book inspired Christina to lean into her healing and share her journey with others.</p><p>When it comes to what she admires most, Christina says it’s her children. She adds, “They have walked through my journey with me. They love me unconditionally and they remind me what matters most.”&nbsp;</p><p>Oprah Winfrey’s story is another source of inspiration for Christina. She admires the way Oprah stepped into her potential and made a difference in people’s lives.</p><p>For Christina, the quote that resonates with her the most is by Maya Angelou, ‘Let nothing dim the light that shines from within’. It’s a reminder for her to always stay true to herself and never lose sight of what truly matters in life.</p><p>Through her love of books and the inspiring figures in her life, Christina has found the strength to share her own story and help others on their own journeys of healing and personal growth.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Strategy of the hour</h4><p>Effective leadership requires a constant vigilance, where leaders reflect on their past, learn from their experiences, and plan for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Christina says, “I do believe this (Constant Vigilance) is strategy that requires reflection, I also believe that without practicing presence and gratitude this will not positively navigate organisations.”&nbsp;</p><p>Christina emphasizes in taking care of oneself to enhance productivity and growth. To achieve this, she prioritizes rest, focus, and meditation. Practicing gratitude and mindfulness helps her stay present, reframe situations positively, and avoid feeling overwhelmed or negative. By making this a conscious choice, she has been able to transform her work, increase her impact, and fuel her personal growth.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Roadblocks</h4><p>Starting a new business is never easy, and Ignite Purpose was no exception. From the beginning, Christina faced a number of significant challenges. The first was building a practice without any clients, but with an unwavering belief in the difference she could make.&nbsp;</p><p>The second was learning how to build financial strategies to ensure long-term success and manage cash flow. The third was bringing new ideas to life that would disrupt traditional ways of working and build a greater impact on people and performance outcomes. And finally, she had to prioritize her personal health and mental well-being in order to find the courage and wisdom to do the necessary work.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these challenges, Christina persevered, and her practice has grown to become a beacon of hope and inspiration for individuals and organizations</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Triggers of growth</h4><p>In the initial year of launching Ignite Purpose, Christina’s dedication and focus to set up the business for success led to burnout. She had to take a three-month break from work, which made her anxious about the future of her business.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this period of rest helped her gain clarity and be more effective in her work. It also made her realize the importance of having support. To address this need, she created an internship program for university graduates, which proved to be a game-changer. The program enabled her to leverage her talents efficiently and get much-needed assistance with administration and logistics.&nbsp;</p><p>“My business started growing and I started loving what I do. This created multiplication in how we grew.”</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Long-standing success</h4><p>To achieve long-standing success, Ignite Purpose follows a four-fold approach that involves a strong focus on financial and strategic planning, a growth-oriented mindset, transformative programs, and a commitment to living their purpose and working with others.&nbsp;</p><p>By prioritizing these four key areas, the company has been able to build a successful and sustainable business model that has allowed them to make a meaningful impact on the lives of their clients.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it’s through its innovative programs or its commitment to fostering collaboration and productivity, Ignite Purpose has established itself as a leader in the field of executive and transformation coaching.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Company highlights</h4><p>In the work done with Primary <a href=#>Health Care</a> networks in Australia, a transformation in people has been witnessed. The individuals in these networks work tirelessly on the frontlines to support GP networks and improve health outcomes for communities.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the challenges of Covid-19, they have taken a crucial role in supporting healthcare workers. In this context, Ignite Purpose has played a critical role in supporting these networks to grow their leadership abilities, shift to a wise and focused culture, and foster deep connections.&nbsp;</p><p>The outcomes of this work have been impressive, with people growing and their ability to work cross-functionally increasing. This has resulted in a workplace culture that is both supportive and empowering, allowing individuals to make a meaningful difference.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Team for the win</h4><p>“We invest in training, supporting our team and helping them maximise their potential.”</p><p>The company’s team is a globally distributed workforce, with members located in Australia, UK, Canada, South Africa, and the Philippines.

Their goal is to create a better world, one where psychologically safe workplaces with better mental health practices become the norm.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbating feelings of mental fatigue, stress, and a lack of control, people are increasingly struggling to connect and work together productively. This is where Christina and her team step in, providing guidance and support to leaders as they navigate complexity, build agility, and create clarity in an uncertain world.&nbsp;</p><p>Their approach is centred on decreasing toxic fear and judgment while increasing self-love, acceptance, and presence. They aim to transform communities and organizations for the better by harnessing the power of connection, belonging, and wisdom. Their vision is a kinder, more peaceful world where fear is not feared, but accepted and overcome.</p><p>Through their work, Christina and her team are helping people heal, organizations transform, and the world be impacted for the better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZLaousitnGaopae9sL%2FEZqeor5WnerCyjJymp6aVmMGqu80%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./use-scenario-manager-excel.html><span>←</span><span>How to Use Scenario Manager in Excel to Quickly Switch Values</span></a>
