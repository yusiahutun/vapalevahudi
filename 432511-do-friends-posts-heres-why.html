Friends who never like your posts, for instance, may make you doubt whether they are your true die-hards or not. So before you start unfriending them, you need to understand that people are different, and not all will be obvious in the way they support the friendship.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/96b45d2096155028.jpg><p class=align-left>While a friend should be someone who has your back all the time, it may be asking too much of them if you want them to like all your posts. Sometimes they may be too occupied to have the time for liking your posts, or they may not be fans of social media altogether. The point is, don't rush to conclusions if your friend never likes your posts because the reason may have nothing to do with you.</p><h2>Friends who never like your posts: Top reasons why</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bff04d2ff286a99d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ best captions for a friends group photo on Instagram</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Why does my best friend never like my pictures? The reason can be anything, but you will never know it without knowing some general things that make friends not to like your posts. If you do not have the courage to ask, you can try to find out on your own. Some of the reasons for this behaviour include:</p><h3>1. They don’t want your post to show on their activity</h3><p class=align-left>When a person likes or comments on a post on some social media sites, the activity will show up on another feed. This sends notifications to mutual friends of your activity on the post. The problem with such a system is that some people prefer remaining private and do not want to be noticed by others. So it puts your pal in a hard place because they are torn between staying true to who they are and pleasing you by liking your post.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cb6b53cc307bb448.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ nice things to comment on your friend's post to hype them up</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This means that your friend does not like your posts only because they are concerned about privacy issues. Perhaps the information you have posted is sensitive, and the friend does not want other mutual friends to see the same. The only thing you can do in such a situation is to respect their decision and understand them.</p><h3>2. You post too much</h3><p class=align-left>Your pal may not spell out that the rate at which you post content is irritatingly too much. Not even your best friend has the time to like all your posts because the reality check is that everyone has a life to live. If this is the problem, you will know it easily because your pals will only like the first few posts and stay mute for the rest of the day.</p><p class=align-left>This does not apply to friends who never like your posts on Instagram entirely but those who react to your posts partially. It is okay to have two or three posts a day to remind friends and <a href=#>family</a> that you are doing okay; seven to ten posts is way out of line for some people.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a32fe3edefacb293.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>130+ best flirty comments for your crush's pics on Instagram</span></p></a><h3>3. No longer following you</h3><p class=align-left>What does it mean when someone stops liking your posts? If that person is your closes friend, then it means they no longer follow you. If it is accidental, you have nothing to worry about, but if it is deliberate, then a big cloud of doom hangs over your friendship.</p><p class=align-left>In the unintentional situation, it only means that the friend accidentally clicked on the unfollow button. He or she hasn't realized that they are not seeing your posts because you are no longer pals on social media. If a pal stops following you deliberately, it means they won’t see and react to your posts.</p><p class=align-left>It could mean that they no longer value the friendship and do not want to be associated with you anymore. Reach out to them to find out if it is something you did wrong. That way, you will know how to rekindle the friendship to where it was before they stopped liking your publication.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4060f5ac3c5a23fc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ sweet paragraphs to send to your best friend today 2021</span></p></a><h3>4. Passive users</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bff04d2ff286a99d.jpg><p class=align-left>Do not confuse passive users with inactive users. While inactive users choose to stay off social media for some time to limit their online activity, passive users may be active all the time, but they don't like to comment. This means you can see them online, and they will see your posts, but seldom will they react.</p><p class=align-left>You can easily identify such users because they do not react to your publications and those of other pals. If you meet with other friends, you will hear statements like, "she doesn't like my Instagram pictures." The truth is that such people go to <a href=#>Facebook</a> or Instagram to look for specific information and go offline when they have had enough.</p><h3>5. Content not interesting</h3><p class=align-left>Why do some Facebook friends never like your posts? There are two ways of looking at this. First, the content you are posting is not interesting for people to view and like. Second, it could also be that your friend is not interested in the kind of content you post. Either way, it would be hard to get your friend to like such posts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/702f949ea511d852.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>When to leave a relationship: 15 signs you should give up on him</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The only remedy is for something to change; otherwise, if you force your pals to like the content they are not interested in, it would be like asking them to be dishonest with you. If you do not want to ruin your friendship by doing that, you can instead start posting interesting content. The content ought to be about things you share in common.</p><h3>6. Tones of distracting ads</h3><p class=align-left>Social media platforms are also engaged in wars as they try to outsmart each other in marketing ideas that make them attractive to investors. One of the areas in which social media websites are maximizing profit is advertising. The likes of Facebook have incorporated ads that pop up or show in the feeds of users.</p><p class=align-left>When there are way too many ads, users may lose interest in paying keen attention to what shows up on their feed. For instance, if your friend likes to shop online, Facebook takes that data and puts ads that will redirect your friend to websites where they can shop. This will distract your pals, making them easily miss or forget to react to your publications.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e974b1ad64e30313.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Why do guys stare but never approach me?</span></p></a><h3>7. Inactive friends</h3><p class=align-left>The fact that your pals have social media accounts does not mean that they will be active all the time. Sometimes they want to be away from their <a href=#>phones</a> and have a quiet moment that gives them peace of mind. So even if the phone shows the friend as online, you shouldn't think that they are deliberately ignoring your publications.</p><p class=align-left>Many people are increasingly embracing inactive sessions as a strategy to decrease their phone usage. This is especially the case among people who realize they are addicted to their phones and want to get rid of the habit. As a result, they may deactivate those apps that consume most of their time for certain durations when they are productive and activate them during free time.</p><h3>8. Lazy friends</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cb6b53cc307bb448.jpg><p class=align-left>Some friends will not lift a finger to get a glass of <a href=#>water</a> even if their life depended on it. If nothing can make such people do tasks of great importance, there is no way they will use their energy and time to like your publications. If you accept them as pals for who they are, you should understand them when they don't show you the support you need on social media.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c080f0700572d346.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to pull away emotionally from a guy you love</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The best they can do is wait till you visit them, and then they will tell you how much they loved your post, yet they did not like it. Furthermore, they also have other pals, and if they decide to react to posts, it won't take them long before they get tired. If you are desperate about getting those likes, you might want to look for friends who are not lazy.</p><h3>9. Turned off notifications</h3><p class=align-left>Some people tend to turn off all notifications more so when there are too many. The consequence is that the friend will not receive notifications when you post content. The tab can sometimes show dozens of notifications waiting to be acted upon. Once you open them, you realize that there is nothing important worth your time.</p><h3>10. They missed your post</h3><p class=align-left>Sometimes you can complicate life by overthinking even the simplest of things. For example, you may have sleepless nights just trying to figure out why your friend never liked a post without knowing that they never saw the post. Perhaps the friend scrolled through their social media feed, but they did not see your post for some reason.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5aa879800d66801e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 biggest pet peeves in relationships that will drive you crazy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Many things can make your friend miss your post. It can be a technical error on the part of the website. Your friend also has hundreds if not thousands of pals on their social media account. If there are too many publications separated by seconds or minutes when they were posted, most of them might not be seen.</p><p class=align-left>Friends who never like your posts may get you into thinking that they are not investing enough into the friendship. It may be true that they got tired of the friendship, or the reason could be something else. Caution should therefore be practised before accusing your best friend of abandoning you.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> shared the top 10 most important <a href=#>reasons to work hard</a> from a young age.
