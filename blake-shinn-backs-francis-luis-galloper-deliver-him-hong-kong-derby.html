We’ve sat in the tower on many an occasion there at Sha Tin and I’ve picked his brain and we get along really well,” Shinn said</p><p>“If I can win this Derby for him and [owner Edmond Lee Man-bun] it would be an absolute dream come true. Part of the reason I’m in Hong Kong is to win a Hong Kong Derby and if I could take it home I would be absolutely stoked.”</p><p>Rated 92, The Irishman is shooting to achieve the rare feat of winning the Derby off a mark south of 100 and will have to do it from gate 13.</p><p>“Unfortunately the barrier gods weren’t in our favour but they’re the cards that we’re dealt and we’re just going to have to play them on the weekend,” Shinn said.</p><p>“It’s going to be a tactical race, it’s going to be a thinking race for every jockey and it’s not simple, but that’s what we’re employed to do.”</p><p>Shinn will take The Irishman back from the wide barrier and after partnering the gelding – who finished second at Group Two level in Australia pre-import – on numerous occasions at trackwork in the past couple of weeks, he is confident he has a handle on what will be required to get the best out of him.</p><p>“I think it’s been pivotal to get the opportunity to ride this horse every day and get an understanding of him,” Shinn said.</p><p>“He’s not a simple horse but having a ride in such a massive race as a Derby, to leave no stone unturned and build that understanding of each other was important.</p><p>“The good thing about our horse is that I don’t believe we’re going to have to change his pattern too much, we’ll just ride him as he’s been racing and the pace of the race – if it’s ran how it looks on paper – might just play into our hands.</p><p>“I believe we’re going in there in as good a shape as we can. He’s a very impressive horse, he’s got a big engine, a great stride and I think he’s going to run his race and hopefully things pan out for him.”</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH2Wamdxb1%2BXuaK3xGaqoaGeo3qjrcKkqmaeopa7pLXSZqOuoaNitKK4y6innqpdmbKttdWeqWagmaJ6qbvNoGSkp56ceqWx0Zuw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marjorie-ann-gortner.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Marjorie Ann Gortner dating?
