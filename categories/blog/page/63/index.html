<a href=../../../../the-psychology-behind-realism.html></a>
Realism as an artistic and literary movement emerged in the mid-19th century. It emphasizes things as it is rather than exaggerating them. In the world of literature and art, the transition of things from the romanticism of scenes and characters to realism and its effects on the real-life world has brought a big change.

Henry Koperski is often shot in the background, just out of focus. The co-writer and accompanist for two of the boldest and most exciting comedy specials of the year — Catherine Cohen’s The Twist …? She’s Gorgeous on Netflix and Matt Rogers’s Have You Heard of Christmas? on Showtime — has rarely taken center stage in the public’s mind.
