It’s kneaded together as you would a yeasted bread dough and left to rest for about 30 minutes, sometimes an hour, during which a transformation occurs and the dough becomes springy and smooth and very lovely to work with, like a freshly-opened can of Play-Doh.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Melanie Lynskey had no idea Jason Ritter proposed to her in awkward interaction</h2><time>Apr 27, 2024</time>
