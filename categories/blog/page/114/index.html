Valladolid y Levante se quedan a medias al no pasar del empate sin goles en Zorrilla tras un partido que tardó en coger ritmo y en el que no hubo demasiadas opciones de gol para que alguno de los dos se hiciera merecedor de una victoria que no llegó. De este modo, los blanquivioletas no pueden encadenar su cuarta victoria consecutiva ante su afición ni acercarse a los puestos de ascenso directo, mientras los granotas se quedan fuera de 'playoffs' al seguir sin ganar a domicilio desde primeros de octubre, en total.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Watches and Wonders: the 2024 Geneva watch fair features 54 brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe, Ca</h2><time>Mar 27, 2024</time>

The 2024 Geneva watch fair opened on Tuesday amid slower demand in China for fancy Swiss timepieces and timid consumer spending across the board on luxury items.
The Watches and Wonders salon, which runs until April 15, sees 54 major watch brands display their latest creations, including Rolex, Patek Philippe, Cartier, Chopard, Hermès and Chanel.
Last year, Swiss watch exports broke records for the third straight year, hitting US$29.5 billion.The 2020 downturn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was quickly reversed by what financial analysts called revenge buying, with consumers splashing out with savings accumulated during lockdowns.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chevy Chase Falls Off-Stage Before Christmas Vacation Panel: Video Hollywood Life</h2><time>Mar 26, 2024</time>

Chevy Chase&nbsp;took a nasty fall while on stage at a screening of&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas Vacation&nbsp;on Wednesday, December 6. The comedy legend, 80, had a major spill off the stage while entering for a Q&A about the classic National Lampoon holiday flick at the Shea’s Performing Arts Center in Buffalo. Fortunately, Chevy appeared okay in the video, shared by&nbsp;TMZ.&nbsp;
Chevy appeared to be making a somewhat strange entrance, as he was rolled out in a wheelchair.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How to Change Your MAC Address on Windows</h2><time>Mar 26, 2024</time>

Fiddling around with network settings is no one's favorite PC activity. Besides the fact that it's not the&nbsp;easiest or most engaging task, there's always the possibility that you might make the wrong tweak and interrupt your Internet access.
However, if you're faced with a situation that requires you to change your MAC address, the good news is that it's a relatively quick and easy procedure — so long as you know what you're doing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jelly Roll's Wife Bunnie Xo Spills Their Pet Names for Each Other</h2><time>Mar 26, 2024</time>

His government name is Jason Bradley DeFord, but since he was a child, his mother and everyone else&nbsp;have called him Jelly Roll.
So that's what he goes by in country music, too.
“My mother named me that whenever I was a little chubby kid," the "Save Me" singer explained. It stuck, with some variations: Some just call him Jason, while others shorten to "Jelly."
The star's&nbsp;wife, Bunnie Xo, however, has some different&nbsp;names&nbsp;that she calls the country music superstar.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Martha A. Ellis | Death Notices</h2><time>Mar 26, 2024</time>

“You should have come on the weekend,” a gem-cutter tells me, his eyeglass fixed in place like an appendage. “It’s much busier then.”
Chanthaburi, about 250km (155 miles) to the southeast of Bangkok, near the Cambodian border, is gaining a reputation as a weekend retreat from the capital, but I am happy to be visiting while only a few tourists stalk the sites.
Chanthaburi is an ideal size for those who like to get acquainted with a place on foot – after a coffee.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why did you originally build CSS-Tricks? Chris Coyier</h2><time>Mar 26, 2024</time>

Beer money.
The first post¹ on CSS-Tricks was on July 4th, 2007. Not my first website, but probably in the first 10 or so. CSS-Tricks was originally supposed to be part of a network of sites that were all designed to be essentially self-help on a niche topic. That network (nothing official, just a bunch of sites all spun up by me) was centered about helping people with problems related to Adobe software.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/113/>← Prev Page</a>
