This time of year is all about mega designer sales, big family gatherings, and cozy, comfy clothes. We’d argue for (nearly) all of us, the latter includes a uniform built around super soft leggings, oversized sweatshirts, and sports bras instead of wired ones whenever humanly possible.

My birthday is just a few weeks away and I am doing all of my prepping for a celebratory trip I have planned ahead of time. I’m a frequent traveler, so I keep a stockpile of my everyday products in TSA-friendly sizes to pack my toiletry bag (full of sunscreen, face and body wash, toothpaste, deodorant, and moisturizer) with sample or travel sizes. Five years ago, when restocking my mini must-haves, I came across the Gillette Venus Mini Razor, a game-changer for hair removal that takes up way less space in my toiletry bag.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/154/>← Prev Page</a>
