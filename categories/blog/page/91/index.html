Last month, someone emailed me to ask how I’d suggest she adapt the Icebox Cake to feed 30 to 40 people. Anyone who has ever emailed me to ask me a question before probably knows what happened next: I answered at least 10 (cough 20) days after the fact.

I base my theory of universal superstition among deer hunters on an admittedly weak theorem. It is that I consider myself intellectually free of superstition and yet I find myself doing things that superstitious persons do. So if I, the totally rational one, the proponent of the facts, can slip into this irrational behavior, it stands to my reasoning that anyone (and maybe everyone) else can as well.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Taylor Swift will be 'spoiled' by Travis Kelce with gifts this Christmas</h2><time>May 4, 2024</time>
