According to an announcement posted on the website of the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control (NIFDC), the Chinese government is proposing new legislation to prohibit the use of cannabis and cannabis extracts in cosmetics, including Cannabis sativa kernel fruit, Cannabis sativa seed oil, Cannabis sativa leaf, as well as cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid that is the subject of much research into its possible health benefits.
