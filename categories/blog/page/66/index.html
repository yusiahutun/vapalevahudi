Marlo Hampton died and was buried on Sunday's "Real Housewives of Atlanta."
We have never seen Eva Marcille the way we saw her on Sunday's episode of "The Real Housewives of Atlanta." She unloaded on Marlo Hampton after weeks and weeks of letting Marlo's jabs fly, and we have to admit, it was kind of amazing.
So the girls are still in Tokyo for Eva's bachelorette party, and the new hour picked up where we left off -- with NeNe Leakes erupting on Tanya Sam before storming out of the restaurant and taking a taxi home.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jessica Simpson Spills on Secret Romance with 'Massive Movie Star' After Nick Lachey Divorce |TMZ TV</h2><time>Jun 16, 2024</time>

I was ready for bed, but of course, fate was not in our favor that night. There was a weird sound coming from the kitchen. Like a hissing. It took a while to track down, but fortunately, we noticed a bit of water under the fridge, and that was it.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Chase Looney Net Worth: 'Fixer to Fabulous' Salary</h2><time>Jun 15, 2024</time>

The most renowned figure in global anti-doping, the man who brought down Lance Armstrong, has spoken out against UK Sport’s use of ketones, exposed by The Mail on Sunday this month.
In what will be seen as a major blow to the image of British sport and GB Olympians abroad, Travis Tygart, chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency, says that organisations such as UK Sport, whose funding focuses on medals, need independent oversight to restrain them from pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Night Court Star Harry Anderson Dead At 65</h2><time>Jun 15, 2024</time>

Orange County Superior Court Judge Kimberly Knill on Wednesday ordered Gross, 76, and his partner Amy Schwartz to stop playing sitcom theme songs and other loud music when they aren’t outdoors for three years and directed them to stay at least five metres away from their next-door neighbours in Laguna Beach.
The neighbours both have modernist, multimillion-dollar trophy homes overlooking the Pacific.
Tech entrepreneur Mark Towfiq sought the restraining order to stop what he alleged was “a targeted campaign of harassment” and retaliation that began after he complained to city officials that the billionaire co-founder of Pacific Investment Management had installed unsightly netting over a million-dollar sculpture in his yard without proper permits.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>16 of the best places to stay in Snowdonia</h2><time>Jun 14, 2024</time>
