She died later at a hospital. Three other people escaped the blaze.</p><p>Her niece gave a victim-impact statement at the sentencing. McChurch also addressed the court.</p><p>“I know that no matter what I say it makes no difference to the family,” he said. “I’m sorry for your loss. Throughout my history I’ve always had impulsive actions. I’ve never planned anything in my life. I’m innocent, man. I didn’t do it. I’ll say that till the day I die.”</p><p>McChurch’s sentence also includes three years of mandatory supervision after his release. He will get credit for the time he served in Rock Island County Jail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46cqaKllWS6sLjIp5xmpZGjeqix06xkbWhdrrKivtJmoKdlYmV%2BeHnAq6qopl2ZsqLAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./london-sock-company-wedding-socks.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Evans-approved London Sock Company has a wedding edit for grooms</span></a>
