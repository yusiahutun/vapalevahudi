Think of Missy Elliott, Sade, and Lauryn Hill. The oversized hoops will never run out of style.</p><h3>2. Fishnets</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/94e016d18312257b.jpg><p class=align-left>It-girls are layering fishnet tights under ripped jeans; bonus if the tops peek out over your waistband or you wear fishnet socks with sneakers or heels. You could go full-on "Hollaback Girl" era, Gwen Stefani. Her love of fishnets, both as tights and as a top, is a trend that has been bubbling back up all over social media.</p><h3>3. Candy-coloured aviators</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa1ce94da833de02.jpg><p class=align-left>Colourful, tinted sunglasses were a popular fashion in the 2000s that appealed to both sexes. Eve, the First Lady of the Ruff Ryders, and the Olsen twins all adored them. Ask Gigi Hadid or any of her friends. While the light-coloured lenses may not do much to block the sun, they are <a href=#>Instagram </a>selfie gold.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3dd9550d1007efc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of Businesses and Properties Owned by Khaligraph Jones</span></p></a><h3>4.

The studded embellishment everywhere, even on a cute bucket hat to make it feel more casual, makes this pea green shirt perfectly work even though it shouldn't.</p><h3>5. Branded tracksuits</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b3dd9550d1007efc.jpg><p class=align-left>Early 2000s fashion can be summed up in one word, "JUICY," which was decorated in rhinestones on the but*ts of pop stars and hotel heiresses everywhere. As seen on Britney, Beyoncé, J. Lo, Lilo, Paris, and every other <a href=#>celebrity</a> you tore out of Teen Vogue and taped to your wall, Juicy Couture tracksuits are early 2000s urban fashion worth trying today.</p><h3>6. Trucker hats</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c78d711a9816f94f.jpg><p class=align-left>Justin Timberlake may have started this craze, but many women added a trucker hat to their ensemble to make it more relaxed on the red carpet.

Cardigans turned your grandparents into one of the most influential fashion icons, from the decline of emo music's influence on the public to the emergence of hipster culture at the end of the 2000s.</p><h3>8. Low-rise jeans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/86ecbc7395de3544.jpg><p class=align-left>Most people got a little ahead of themselves and demanded the low-rise jean's comeback as early as 2015.

Oversized belts</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e9f4f3ca75fc0fcd.jpg><p class=align-left>During her appearance at the Super Bowl 2001, Beyoncé nailed the 2000s fashion trifecta: low-rise, cropped pirate trousers with an enormous belt.

Emo hair</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f42068c4d430394b.jpg><p class=align-left>The rise of pop-punk and the Vans Warped Tour in the middle of the decade spawned these shaggy haircuts. It was the introduction of Justin Bieber back in 2008 that sealed the style into popular culture. Either way, the shaggy, bangs-heavy haircut became such a cultural icon that it was immortalized on Bieber's wax statue.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/148bf20fc5fd3605.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The 15 best female neo-soul artists of all time, ranked</span></p></a><h3>11.

Around the time fitted was hitting peak popularity, retro headwear was gracing both women's and men's heads with a more classic style.</p><h3>12. Messenger bags</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8bb16bc9c9047768.jpg><p class=align-left>For all the love backpacks have today, messenger bags were the motion back in the aughts. As fixie bike culture began to swell, the bag of choice for bike messengers everywhere came right with it. While their practicality has stayed the same, the lack of people adopting bike messenger positions left people opting for the easier, more universal backpack instead.</p><h3>13. Hipsters</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/408b8fc02166afaf.jpg><p class=align-left>If your jeans weren't wide-legged, were you wearing jeans in the 2000s?

Oversize trousers</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0591e6c3c3936ce4.jpg><p class=align-left>Women and men in the 2000s were rocking baggy clothing. The outfit was purportedly first worn in the 1980s and 1990s by the rap group Kriss Kross. Its popularity grew steadily and peaked in the 2000s. Rappers like <a href=#>P Diddy,</a> Cam'ron, and Dipset helped to popularize the genre at the time.</p><h3>17. Camouflage pants</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c1d658ed2820698c.jpg><p class=align-left>They were also known as camo pants, and both men and women wore them during the 2000s.

Some celebrities still wear the outfit now, which was one of the major fashion fads in the 2000s. Both men and women now cover their hands, neck, and heads with bandana scarves. The bandana is another early 2000s hip-hop fashion trend to try out in 2022.</p><h3>19. Crop tops</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4dcc61592e12fa46.jpg><p class=align-left>Hip-hop 2000s fashion for black girls is here to stay.
