We’ve always been curious, too, and in a new interview, the show’s longtime host, <a href=#>Vanna White</a>, gave us some insight. In fact, she told a sweet story about how one contestant adopted a child after taking home their cash prize.</p><p>“We had one woman [who told us] that they adopted a child. And of course, they’d send the pictures [with] ‘Here’s the child I adopted,'” Vanna told <a href=#>People</a>. “It’s very heartwarming to see those letters come in, how it has affected so many people.” Our hearts are melted, too…</p><p>And that’s not the only happy ending Vanna had to share. “We have made a lot of people happy,” she added. “People pay off their student loans, they buy their first homes, they go on honeymoons, they buy cars that they’ve never had. So it changes a lot of people’s lives.” Vanna loves changing people’s lives, too. “One guy did win a brand new car, and he turned to Pat [Sajak] and he said ‘I don’t have to take the bus anymore,'” she gushed. “So that was something.”</p><p>When the winners aren’t changing their own lives for the better, they’re also doing what they can to help others! “We’ve had other people that have taken the money and have started charities, or have helped organizations that help other people, not just themselves,” Vanna said. So amazing!</p><p>Perhaps the good spirit behind the show is what has kept the 60-year-old around for nearly four decades. When rumors started to swirl that <a href=#>Vanna is leaving Wheel of Fortune</a>, she responded that she’s “never been tempted to leave because it’s so much fun.” She added, “It would be like leaving a family — I just can’t do that.” We hope you stay around forever, Vanna!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46vmKemkWLEqbXTnmSwoJWauW67xWadqKqkqrumedaipaedomKupbvPrZydZWFphHV%2Flmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pokmon-london-city-pikachu-plush-20333505.html><span>←</span><span>Pokmon London City Pikachu plush toy revealed to mark launch of London Pokmon Center</span></a>
