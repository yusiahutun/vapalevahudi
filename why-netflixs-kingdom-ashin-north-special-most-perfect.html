I wondered how she was able to come up with the most perfect story of the Kingdom series in such a short time.”</p><p>Kim Eun-hee explained that the latest episode will act as a stepping stone for the series’ third season. “I was looking for ways to add a backstory to season three and came up with an idea to make a special episode,” she said. “The roles from this episode eventually continue on to the third season.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What to know about Son Ye-jin’s new role in Thirty-Nine</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/07/21/11e9918f-995a-47da-9d30-c04c594def2e_6552fd81.jpg>She described Ashin as a “strong and dangerous” character. “She is not like <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">any other villain from previous seasons</span></a>. She is the source that triggers the rest of the characters to grow and stirs up the tension of the plot,” she noted.Adding that she wrote the character with Jun in mind, she explained that she has been a fan of the actress. “Jun fits into such a wide spectrum of roles. Many know her as the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">‘queen of romcom’</span></a>, but I thought that the dark characters she played in Assassination and The Berlin File were memorable,” the writer said.<p>“Ashin has her own trauma from the past, but she is a tough and fierce warrior on the outside. I was thinking of Jun when I was writing the script, but I was worried that she might not accept the role.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How Song Kang became the ‘son of Netflix’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jun, who is also known as Gianna Jun, expressed excitement to get on board with such a popular series.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“In my opinion, Kingdom is not a zombie flick, but rather a genre of its own. Since I was such a huge fan of this series, I had to take the role,” she said, adding that she had previously told the writer that she wanted to star in the series even as a zombie. “When I read the script, I could see that the series could endlessly expand its cinematic universe.
