I don’t eat potato salad for lunch. That would be… unhealthy, irresponsible, gluttonous, and nutritionally unbalanced. However, I have found that when potato salad exists in the fridge, it has a way of becoming lunch, usually through a nibble that becomes a forkful which eventually leads to succumbing to the fact that potato salad, on occasion, make a fine carb-bomb of a warm weather lunch.
Fortunately, there are entries in the potato salad archives for times just like these.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Use Pain Reprocessing Therapy to End Chronic Pain</h2><time>Jun 24, 2024</time>

Psychotherapist Alan Gordon, LCSW was in grad school the first time he was hit with chronic back pain and debilitating headaches. “I went the traditional route where I met with doctors,” he describes to First for Women. “I got MRIs. I think I must have done 250 physical therapy appointments over two or three years. I got acupuncture, I did acupressure, I was doing Reiki.” However, nothing was working, and Gordon realized that there were millions of people like him who were unable to find long-term relief from conventional treatment options.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Wonder Woman Gal Gadot shares a first look at her stunning walk-in wardrobe</h2><time>Jun 24, 2024</time>

In the February 1932 issue of Modern Screen, Joan Crawford dismissed the rumors of her love affair with Clark Gable as just good acting. “I am supposed to be madly in love with a certain other actor in Hollywood,” she said coyly. “Before the camera, we were in love. Now that the picture is over, we are merely good friends!”&nbsp;
Of course, she wasn’t telling the truth. In the early 1930s, Joan and Clark did begin an affair so torrid and gossiped about that MGM Studios’ brass stepped in and forced them apart.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lucy Decinque</h2><time>Jun 23, 2024</time>

Happy 2024, everyone! It’s a new year with a soon-to-be new show on CBS. After Midnight will premiere the day after the Emmys/M.L.K. Day this year, and host Taylor Tomlinson went on The Late Show to demonstrate a proof of concept. The stand-up led Stephen Colbert through a game of “Ick or No Ick,” which, tbh, gave me the ick. The point of @midnight was deliciously simple: Tell the best, shortest joke, and win points.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/60/>← Prev Page</a>
