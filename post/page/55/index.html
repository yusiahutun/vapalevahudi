Hongkongers usually love going to Korea this time of the year, but it’s absolutely freezing there. So it makes sense that a lot of the country’s cuisine consists of spicy flavours and warming stews. Even the desserts are dense to keep you cosy in the crisp weather.

The word fascia is derived from the Latin for “band”, and Dr David Cosman of the Cosman Health Group in Hong Kong describes it as a “silver skin”.
Until recently, it wasn’t considered important and was dismissed as “packing material” without any real purpose. It was only a decade ago that fascia was recognised in some scientific circles as the body’s largest organ, with our skin coming a close second, and is so rich in nerve endings that it’s just as sensitive.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/54/>← Prev Page</a>
