Unhealthy fascia, says Cosman, has a “sticky relationship” with its adjacent muscle tissue, so is unable to glide and the nerve endings can’t sense any changes, except for pain nerve endings which feel the impingement of adhered or sticky tissue.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is “densified” fascia, and can account for different cases of referred or shooting pain, which is often diagnosed as a “pinched nerve”. Nerves can be pinched by many means, but densified fascia as a cause is often overlooked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/06/3a75dfba-9830-4b60-b0fa-4eae2f90f560_ed18453d.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">What can go wrong?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If the fascia is inhibited in its “gliding” because it’s sticky, it adheres to muscle – this might be the result of injury, but could be due to poor posture. In time, if not dealt with effectively or quickly, these “adhesions” worsen, which make the fascia tighten and contort muscles that it surrounds, which can result in tender spots.</p>Three factors that could cause fascia adhesions include a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">sedentary lifestyle</span></a>, repetitive movement that overworks one body part, and trauma such as injury or surgery.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">How can I keep it healthy?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That’s why staying active and hydrated are crucial, says Cosman. Keeping your fascia in top condition requires physical activity, good posture, a healthy weight and diet, sufficient restorative sleep and low stress.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">We are largely made up of water – in muscle and fascia, it makes up as much as 75 per cent. If we don’t drink enough, those necessary fluid ratios are compromised. Water flushes waste out, and another factor that affects the smooth workings of fascia is cellular waste.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When it is working normally, fascia is full of water and moves freely as we move,” says Amanda Oswald at the UK’s Pain Care Clinic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/06/5b894ace-7c20-4c13-ab47-c098e06941dc_4fb22009.jpg>It’s important to keep moving throughout the day and not just at the gym, especially given our desk- and <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">device-bound lives</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Youthfulness is the ability to move freely without pain,” Cosman says. Joints and muscles that are either compensating or overstressed because of adhesions in the fascia can cause painful, uneven torque or tugging on joints. This might be diagnosed as arthritis, but reducing the adhesions – known as myofascial release – can help reduce pain, sometimes immediately.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Oswald agrees and says that often this type of pain is overlooked in conventional medicine. For example, the symptoms of repetitive strain injury are mostly felt in the hands and wrists, but the restrictions causing them are in the neck and shoulders.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Focusing treatment only where symptoms are felt misses the cause. And identifying causes in turn balances behaviours that may contribute to pain – the way we sit to work, for example.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">How can we fix the fascia?</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cosman uses a system called the Stecco Method Fascial Manipulation, developed by Italian physiotherapist Luigi Stecco. It uses a patient’s history to help trace the causes and connections of pain, then works on manipulating adhesions and those “densifications” to rebalance soft tissues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Like every organ in our body, the fascia is supported by good diet. Lauren Roxburgh, a wellness educator based in California, says that foods that contribute to collagen production (especially those rich in vitamin C and zinc) are important as fascia is made up of collagen and, as we age, our body is less able to produce enough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/06/ce5c4992-c915-48ca-81e8-b269a3d36828_cf607ed4.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/05/06/3415a8b1-10c3-467e-bd5b-a208a8ab2c60_16c14cd9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Collagen is also good for our complexions, so we’re supporting skin on the outside as well as this skin on the inside. She advocates bone broth, which is full of amino acids and collagen, and citrus and colourful peppers, which are high in vitamin C. Other “fascia foods” that support collagen’s production include berries, avocados and, happily, chocolate and red wine.</p>Intermittent fasting can help reduce inflammation in connective tissue, and help unglue sticky fascia. <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Eating more alkaline foods</span></a> – most fruits and vegetables, soybeans and tofu, and some nuts, seeds and legumes – is good for our fascia, which objects to an environment that is too acidic because it affects the fascia’s ability to retain water, Roxburgh says.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Keeping our fascia in good condition won’t just mean pain-free movement – it makes for good body alignment, increased blood flow to muscles, reduced appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, scar tissue healing, and improved sports performance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now get up and stretch your silver skin out.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘It isn’t a diet, it’s a lifestyle’: the benefits of intermittent fasting</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Six tips to keep your fascia fit</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">1.</strong> Stretch for 10 minutes a day, especially if your job is a sedentary one. Stretching elongates muscles, which helps to release tension.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">2.</strong> Visit the sauna. Both traditional steam saunas and newer infrared saunas help improve exercise recovery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">3.</strong> Apply a little cold therapy to sore spots. An ice pack or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel applied to an area of soreness for a short time helps reduce inflammation, which means less swelling and pain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">4.</strong> Use a foam roller, which can get into the fascia in much the same way that a deep-tissue massage does. Rolling regularly helps to “lubricate” your joints and reduce inflammation and can break up thickness and adhesion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">5.</strong> Get your heart pumping – and your blood flowing. Every organ in your body, including the fascia, needs a good supply of freshly oxygenated blood.</p><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">6.</strong> <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">And keep hydrated</span></a>.
