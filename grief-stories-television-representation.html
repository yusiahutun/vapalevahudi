Daniel Levy’s Good Grief – which comes to Netflix on 5 January and marks Levy’s feature film directorial debut – tells the emotional story of Marc (played by Levy) as he navigates life as a widower after the death of his husband, Oliver (Luke Evans). Marc slowly rebuilds his shattered heart with the help of his two closest friends, Thomas and Sophie (Himesh Patel and Ruth Negga), during a soul-searching trip to Paris.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Good Grief: Official Trailer (Netflix)" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dan-levy-luke-evans-good-grief-656f4e3c3bb3e.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Just watching the trailer had me welling up. “I’ve been reading that the brain is like a muscle – that’s why getting over death is so hard, because your brain has been trained to feel things for a person,” says Levy, as a montage of Marc and his late husband plays. “When they go away, your head is still operating under the impression that it should feel those things for that person, like muscle memory.” This encapsulates the feeling of grief perfectly: your mind and heart long to be with that person again, but instead, you're left with an ache that takes years to heal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Levy, who rose to fame for his sensitive, nuanced performance as David Rose on Schitt’s Creek, found inspiration for Good Grief in the passing of his beloved dog, Redmond, and the death of his grandmother. “I think it was a lack of clarity on my emotional journey that led me to Good Grief, to be honest,” Levy explained to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2024/01/01/daniel-levy-discusses-love-and-loss-with-his-new-good-grief-film/?sh=5e9835eb1b87" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Forbes class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Forbes</a>. “I didn’t know what to make of my brain, I didn’t know what to make of my heart, I didn’t know what to make of the feelings that I was experiencing.”</p><img alt="a man holding a phone" title="good grief " width=3736 height=2076 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/good-grief-n-00-11-02-06r-659440742320c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Dan Levy in Good Grief, which comes to Netflix in January 2024</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Good Grief reminds me of the famous quote by the author Jamie Anderson: “Grief, I’ve learned, is really just love. It’s all the love you want to give, but cannot. All that unspent love gathers up in the corners of your eyes, the lump in your throat, and in that hollow part of your chest. Grief is just love with no place to go.” Levy's project wouldn’t be as sensitive and as emotionally accurate if he hadn’t experienced not only the pain that comes with losing someone, but also the beauty in learning to laugh and love again, with the help of those friends that stick by your side no matter how ugly things get.</p><img alt="a group of people posing for the camera" title="good grief " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/good-grief-20221102-07279r-6594402a3627f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>“Just watching the trailer for Good Grief had me welling up.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Grief is deeply isolating and can cause feelings of loneliness, which others can find difficult to understand,” explains TV psychologist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.ekenny.co.uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emma Kenny" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Emma Kenny</u></a>. “When grief is portrayed and represented on TV and social media it reminds the individual struggling that they’re not alone and, more importantly, that they are acknowledged and understood. Grief can be traumatising and complex, so when they see others saying that these reactions are understandable and also common, it can help soothe the sting of loss.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Loss is a terrifying, isolating thing that seems a foreign language to those yet to go through it, so watching a character's experiences onscreen can help someone to understand what they don't yet know. Likewise, for those who are grieving, it's comforting to feel that you aren't alone. But, most importantly, these stories provide spaces to talk about death and grief more openly.</p><img alt="miranda and charlotte come to carrie's aid, proving what good friends are for anthony and stanford vow to let go of their petty arguments" title="And Just Like That" width=6944 height=2778 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/and-just-like-that-grief-1649925853.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">HBO/Warner Bros</span><p>Sarah Jessica Parker attending Big's funeral brought up difficult emotions</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I've found great comfort in shows like This Is Us, After Life, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/a39370869/heidi-bivens-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Euphoria class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Euphoria</a> and the Sex and the City reboot <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a38973572/in-defence-and-just-like-that/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="And Just Like That..." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">And Just Like That...</a>. The Pearson family in This Is Us learn how to keep someone's memory alive, as well as the importance of letting go and creating new memories entirely. When Rebecca (played beautifully by Mandy Moore) returns home to tell her children that their father, Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) has died, I cried uncontrollably; I remember that day in my own story painfully well. In fact, I lost count of how many times I cried with my partner on the sofa watching all six seasons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This Is Us fast became my favourite show I've ever watched: I felt like I had space to grieve again and process those lost emotions that time rubs out. Ricky Gervais’ After Life continued to depict how anger can take over when you lose someone you love; Zendaya’s lead in Euphoria as troubled teenager Rue demonstrated the bad decisions we might make to numb the pain of loss; while the return of Carrie Bradshaw highlighted the heartbreaking reality of being a widow.</p><img alt="a man and woman hugging" title="this is us " width=1260 height=840 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nup-189400-0102-6595270c1505c.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">NBC Universal</span><p>This Is Us fast became my favourite TV show</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“We're not just here for us, we're here for others” – Tony Johnson in After Life<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img alt="after life, grief" title="After Life, grief " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/after-life-1648660270.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Ricky Gervais in After Life</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Sadly, we don’t talk nearly enough about death and dying, and because we fail to normalise this completely natural human event, we make the process of grieving feel like a secret emotional experience which can feel very abandoning,” notes Kenny. “To see others reflect your feelings, sentiments, process and pain openly creates a permission base for you to do the same.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When And Just Like That... first landed on our screens in 2021, I watched Big’s funeral through bleary eyes, my best friend and I clinging to each other. We knew exactly which moment we'd been transported back to – saying goodbye to my dad, who died in 2014. He was as much of a father figure to her as he was to me, regularly teasing her for her ginger hair or doing a special bedtime show with our teddies. But most of all, he loved how much we loved each other. It breaks my heart that he never knew we finally played out our Mary-Kate and Ashley childhood games in our 'New York apartment', instead swapping the East Village for our East London flat. Or that every time we do karaoke, we sing our hearts out to Anastasia, because she was his guilty pleasure. Watching the scene together almost gave us permission to talk about him and our shared grief.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“By opening up these conversations, an opportunity for emotional catharsis is presented,” explains Kenny. “The more grief is normalised, the more those grieving feel entitled to speak about their pain and loss.” It’s true – this moment made me feel less alone. When we grieve, it’s easy to not make the time for it, but this moment made us do just that.<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“How long it seems that we’ve known him and yet, not near long enough.” – Miranda Hobbs, And Just Like That...<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I’m not the only one finding comfort on screen. “Never Have I Ever made me realise that grief comes in such different ways and you have to do what’s best for you,” writer Michelle Theil tells me. She lost her dad aged 19 and says she found great comfort in the Netflix show, which also helped her decide to go to therapy. “The show has a character who lost her dad and she kind of carried on with things like I did, and for a long time I continued to still feel like a little kid.”</p><img alt="never have i ever l to r maitreyi ramakrishnan as devi vishwakumar in episode 207 of never have i ever cr isabella b vosmikovanetflix © 2021" title="Never Have I Ever " width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/never-have-i-ever-1649924322.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">ISABELLA B.

You don’t have to do what people are telling you to do, it takes time to realise what’s best for you.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the final episodes of Euphoria's second season, Rue opens up to Lexi (Maude Apatow) about how she’s dealt with the loss of her father by numbing herself with drug abuse. She has watched her own journey re-enacted in the form of Lexi’s school play, and seen how her behaviour looked through the eyes of her former best friend. We watch as the play showcases Rue’s father’s funeral over and over again; how Rue spirals and repeatedly turns to drugs. She watches her life change on stage, but the performance also gives her a new perspective on her trauma. She decides from that moment to be more forgiving of herself.</p><img alt="euphoria grief" title="Euphoria grief" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/08-01-euphoria-s02-1648660530.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2"> </span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Sky</span><p>Zendaya gives a moving performance as Rue in Euphoria</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We learn things from other people, from TV and film,” agrees Theil. “We internalise a lot, so if we’re watching a show with grief portrayal and you have a scene where the family and friends are supporting and talking to each other, then you file that away in the back of your mind and apply it to real-life when it happens to someone close to you.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“I miss you, Dad.

It’s astonishing how many friends disappear when someone is facing a critical loss, and inevitably this kind of abandonment can add to an already hyper-painful time. The best action is to just show up and ask them what they’d find helpful.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Crucially, television reminds us that there is no right or wrong way to deal with grief, but that we should give ourselves the permission to discuss our feelings openly. However, watching grief representation onscreen when you’re going through it yourself can be incredibly difficult and triggering. Do so sensitively, research a show's content beforehand, and make sure you're in the right frame of mind before jumping in.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here’s hoping for more sensitively told stories.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">What do I do if I get triggered by grief onscreen?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Whenever grief strikes out of the blue, and you’re wondering why you’re suddenly overwhelmed, take note of what’s happening to make you feel that way,” advises Kenny. “Usually, it’s something that may have caused you to remember an obscure detail of your loved one, maybe a scene in a hospital, or someone talking about a death that reflects the one you experienced. Try to reflect on what aspect affected you most as this will offer insight as to why you responded so strongly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"You cannot avoid triggers permanently, but you can choose to take time away from programmes and social media feeds that cover the aspect you have identified. Remember that part of the healing process is to gradually feel less devastated and therefore less regularly triggered and to notice this improvement you will need to expose yourself to certain difficult reminders over time as these will help you gauge where you are on your healing journey.”</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How to help those grieving</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“You cannot heal the grief, but you are likely able to help them keep on top of the cleaning or paying bills – and you can ensure they have enough nutritious food in their fridge ,as people often stop practising self-care when they are struggling,” says Kenny. “Allow them to cry as they need and just be present with them when they do, avoid telling them that things will be ok, or that time will heal their loss and instead, just reassure them that you intend to support them during this awful time. Allow them to talk about their loved one and don’t be afraid of sharing your own stories and recollections. This person may be lost, but they will definitely not be forgotten.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6K2r7CMm6adsV%2BWgHqBlmxvb2xfnL%2BqscVmqq2nop6ytHnTnqOerpmotrC6jKucqaqVqLKvwMCtoKimXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-postpartum-swimsuits.html><span>←</span><span>Best Postpartum Swimsuits</span></a>
