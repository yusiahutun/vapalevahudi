When she returned 10 days later, she found the girl was not breathing in the playpen and called 911. Emergency responders found the child was “extremely dehydrated” and pronounced her dead shortly after they arrived.</p><p>An autopsy by the Cuyahoga County medical examiner’s office determined that the toddler died of starvation and severe dehydration.</p><p>County Common Pleas Court Judge Brendan Sheehan told Candelario she committed “the ultimate betrayal” by leaving her daughter alone without food.</p><p>“Just as you didn’t let Jailyn out of her confinement, so too you should spend the rest of your life in a cell without freedom,” Sheehan said. “The only difference will be, the prison will at least feed you and give you liquid that you denied her.”</p><p>Candelario, who has struggled with depression and related mental health issues, said she has prayed daily for forgiveness.</p><p>“There’s so much pain that I have in regards to the loss of my baby, Jailyn,” she said. “I’m extremely hurt about everything that happened. I am not trying to justify my actions, but nobody knew how much I was suffering and what I was going through … God and my daughter have forgiven me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46nmK2hn6OurXnNnq6sZ5GlerC0yKhkpqedYsSpu4ylnJ%2BsXam8pbDLnqlmmZyku6Z5kGlknZmpqHq4tMSnZKyglWLEprrTZqanZaaWsKLAyKilZqicmq6lv4ygrKKkpK56tbuMmp6gqpGrrrWxw2akrqqUmr9w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./450151-list-female-espn-hosts-watch.html><span>←</span><span>List of all female ESPN hosts you should watch this 2023</span></a>
