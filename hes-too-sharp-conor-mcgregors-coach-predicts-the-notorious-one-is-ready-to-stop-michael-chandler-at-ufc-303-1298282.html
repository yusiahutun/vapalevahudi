It does. 'My passion' and 'my love of this,' it's a job, and it's hard to keep the level of intensity. Even if it's not physical, the level of mental intensity, of always thinking about training, always thinking about sequences, always thinking about techniques."&nbsp;</p><p>"That's something Conor's had naturally his whole career. So even though there's times when he's off filming, he's doing this, he's doing that, we're still always having conversations back and forth, whereas some fighters are like, 'If I'm not fighting, I don't even want to look at shows. I'll just get ready when there's a fight coming up.' And that's really held to him because he's come back on the mats as sharp as ever. Of course, we've got to get the rounds in and get the conditioning up to be ready for competition, but his technique is as sharp as ever." <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><br><h2 id=6626b5b50601b>Conor McGregor Plans for Michael Chandler at UFC 303</h2><p>Conor McGregor will step inside the UFC octagon after almost three years.
