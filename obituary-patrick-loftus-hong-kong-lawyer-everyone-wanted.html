"My lovely husband … He was everything in one person," said his widow, Peggy Lo. "I've lost a husband, a good friend and my soul-mate."<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born in Australia, Loftus joined the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Hong Kong in 1989 and distinguished himself by winning a series of high-profile murder cases.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1996 he led the prosecution of the 18-year-old son of a police sergeant, who was sentenced to life for the beating and murder of a taxi driver in a trial that gripped the city. He returned the same year to Australia, where his reputation in court had preceded him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"He was always sought after, both by prosecutors and defendants," Lo said. "Every criminal wanted him on their side. He had a good business back there."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Hong Kong remained in his heart and he came back to the city four years later as a barrister with Wellington Chambers. His position brought him into contact with a range of people eager to use his talents.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of his most remarkable cases, Lo said, was the trial of the killers of triad kingpin Lee Tai-Lung, who had been run down and hacked to death in a gangland killing in Tsim Sha Tsui.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Loftus represented the defendants, reportedly members of the Wo Shing Wo triad, in a trial that ultimately saw three of the five suspects jailed for life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Director of Public Prosecutions Keith Yeung Ka-hung wrote that Loftus was an "old friend" of the department.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Those of us who knew Pat would not forget that he was a conscientious but fair counsel who treated life seriously but at the same time with a good sense of humour," Yeung wrote in a message to colleagues. "He was a gentleman to all around him … commanding the respect which he so rightly deserved."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Loftus was an avid traveller, visiting exotic destinations such as India and Papua New Guinea. Ireland, his father's birthplace, held special significance. He and his wife had been planning a heritage tour of the nation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Loftus is survived by his wife and daughters Katherine, Allyson and Susan. His funeral will be held on Sunday.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Lawyer everyone wanted in their corner</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZi%2FqrnEaJirrJmYuaZ7kHFnb2pmZ3ywrsitrJqqqWK9osDRopqkZZyks7XB0mafqKaXYriwusZmo5qvqZq%2FbrHVnqmyp56aeritza2cnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./legendary-canadian-singer-songwriter-gordon-lightfoot-dies-at-84.html><span>←</span><span>Legendary Canadian Singer/Songwriter Gordon Lightfoot Dies at 84</span></a>
