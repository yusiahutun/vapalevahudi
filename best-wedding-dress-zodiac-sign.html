Of course, that doesn't mean it won't be blinged out with sequins, lace, or crystals, making it fancy enough for a black-tie event and casual for a low-key ceremony/reception. Some major benefits of wearing pants on their big day? This ram will be able to run around their party, dance freely, and greet guests easily in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>jumpsuit</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(Note: This product is currently sold out; for something similar, we recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Katya Top</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Embellished Whitely Pants</a>).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-taurus></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Taurus</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This style is pure old-school Hollywood elegance, which is the perfect look for Taurus who is known for their glitzy sentiments. If the Bull opts for this style in chiffon or lace with a sweeping train, they'll be radiating serious Veronica Lake and Lena Horne vibes from the 1940s — especially with their hair down and parted to the side or styles short with flowers. This $96 option from Lulu's definitely nails it.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gemini></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gemini</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Being that Geminis are the twin sign of the zodiac, it makes sense for them to opt for separates that pair perfectly together, like ASOS's lace set ($200). A two-piece outfit consisting of a slightly cropped bateau top and full skirt will make for a casual yet sophisticated look that they can wear for an afternoon, twilight, or evening affair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(Note: This product is currently sold out; for something similar, we recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Little Mistress Bridal Maxi Dress</a>).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cancer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cancer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cancers might find themselves gravitating toward sweetheart dress styles since the design secretly speaks volumes about their emotions. Not only is the top half curved to look like a heart — a classic and romantic detail, which hints toward their innermost sentiments — it'll also help show off that part of the body (AKA their décolletage) for something more literal. David's Bridal has a wide selection of options, many of which are under $1,000.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-leo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Leo</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's common knowledge that Leos love to make bold statements; they simply enjoy the drama and flair of making a theatrical entrance. A ball gown is the best way for this lion to let everyone know that they're the one that all eyes should be fixated on (ok, ok, fine — them and their significant other). With a voluminous, statement piece like this, Leo will also live up to its reputation of being the most regal sign of the zodiac, while ensuring they shine all night long.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-virgo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Virgo</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Virgos tend to prefer less frills and a simpler style of clothing, and the same goes for the dress they'll wear while walking down the aisle. However, the earth sign will also benefit from mixing an easy, effortlessly glam creation with a skin-baring twist, meaning a timeless, backless style that fits like a glove — much like this pick from Shona Joy — will be the perfect choice.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-libra></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Libra</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">An elegant, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>empire waist dress</a> will ensure that Libra feels like their fairytale romance and happily ever after ending is finally here. The addition of crystals, lace, or fine materials — anything to help make their flowy dress look like a piece of art that transcends time — will help the air sign create their ultimate wedding day vibe. We're partial's to Torrid's $198 design.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scorpio></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scorpio</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Scorpio is known to have intense energy, when it comes to their wedding gown, a simpler look, like Reformation's Tullamore Dress ($528), is best. The reason? <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>A slip dress</a> can radiate the sleek yet seductive vibes they're aiming for without going overboard. Plus, there's no such thing as basic for Scorpio. This sign will harness their passionate nature with the little extras, like wearing deep red lipstick or nail polish or adding roses to their too-cool look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(Note: This product is currently sold out; for a similar style, we recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Joana Silk Dress</a>).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sagittarius></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sagittarius</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Being that Sagittarius rules the hips and thighs, a trumpet-style dress is calling their name. It accentuates their hips and flares out mid-thigh to the ankles, which means it's not only breathtaking to look at (like this Justin Alexander pick) but easy to move in. The cut will no doubt come in handy when this sign hits the dance floor, and will only add to the fun of their big day (the most important detail).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-capricorn></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Capricorn</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sea-goat favors more traditional looks, which is why they'll lean towards wearing a dress that features flowing bell sleeves (usually made from lace or chiffon), like this Maggie Sottero design, which will keep them warm while honoring the vintage aesthetic that this sign tends to love. The good thing about this dress style is that Capricorn can either lean into the throwback aesthetic or make it feel fresh and modern, depending on how they accessorize and the fabric they pick.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-aquarius></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Aquarius</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to fashion, Aquarius <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>marches to the beat of their own drum</a> due to their unique nature. Their wedding will be fashion-forward and veer from tradition — which is exactly what will make it exciting. Obviously, we can't expect the water-bearer to go with anything too generic, so a plunging V-neck wedding dress in an unconventional color — whether it's pink, like this Bronx and Banco option, black, or gold — is our pick for what will best align with their wedding vision.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pisces></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pisces</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Is there a better match for a water sign than a mermaid-style strapless dress, like this one from Azazie? Pisces are symbolized by fish, so it totally makes sense for them to wear a dress that physically depicts their innate and transcendent state of being. The dreamy and mystical design will make Pisces feel as though they are floating through the air — or rather, walking on water — as they make their way down the aisle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(Note: This product is currently sold out; for something similar, we recommend <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>David's Bridal Collection Organza Mermaid Wedding Dress</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK571p6bnaGenMBwrsSsq2avlZmxqrrGZpurnaOoeru7w6KYnGWjnrSv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natasha-richardson.html><span>←</span><span>Natasha Richardson</span></a>
