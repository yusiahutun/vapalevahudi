Sgt. Jake Driskell of the JCSD Narcotics Division used a civilian’s kayak to paddle out to the woman, as well.</p><figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-default"><span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle=modal data-target=.modal-122024a2-45e5-11ee-9a9f-afd8027805ae><span class="fas tnt-expand"></span></span> <span class=caption-text><p>Powers volunteer Dwayne Walters on a borrowed personal watercraft.
