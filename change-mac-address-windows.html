Besides the fact that it's not the&nbsp;easiest or most engaging task, there's always the possibility that you might make the wrong tweak and interrupt your Internet access.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, if you're faced with a situation that requires you to change <a href=#>your MAC address</a>, the good news is that it's a relatively quick and easy procedure — so long as you know what you're doing.</p><p>Here's a complete guide on how to change your MAC address on a Windows PC.</p><h2 id=what-is-a-mac-address>What is a MAC Address?</h2><p>A MAC address is a crucial element of both wired and wireless networking. In order to feed the correct data to any given computer, there has to be some way of identifying that device; because its completely unique, the <a href=#>MAC address assigned to your hardware</a>&nbsp;makes sure the right information is beamed to the right place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Network adapters are assigned their unique MAC address during manufacturing, and as such some companies opt to place an alphanumeric sequence at the beginning of the address as an identifier.</p><p>Despite being closely linked to IP addresses, the fact that MAC addresses don't change&nbsp;makes them a useful tool for network administrators when they're <a href=#>attempting to diagnose a problem</a>. Of course, while the address won't change of its own accord, it is possible to change the twelve-digit code if you have the necessary knowledge.</p><h2 id=why-change-your-mac-address>Why Change Your MAC Address?</h2><p>There are many reasons why you might need to change your MAC address. For instance,&nbsp;if your ISP or system administrator limits Internet access to certain MAC addresses, you might find that you're unable to connect, once&nbsp;you replace your original network adapter.&nbsp;It might take a while for the administrator or company&nbsp;to remedy the situation by amending their records, but you can switch your MAC address to have the problem solved in minutes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Privacy also comes into play. Security experts have raised the question of whether MAC addresses <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">might pose a security risk</a>, but&nbsp;changing the address tied to your hardware makes it a little more difficult for prospective hackers to track your movements.</p><p>Of course, there are some uses of MAC address spoofing that&nbsp;would be considered illegal in many countries. Changing your MAC address is legal in of itself, but using the process to carry out illegal acts can&nbsp;still land you in trouble with authorities.</p><h2 id=how-to-change-mac-address-on-windows-10>How to Change MAC Address on Windows 10</h2><p>To get started, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>&nbsp;into the search bar and click the <a href=#>Control Panel</a> section that pops up as a result. From that window,&nbsp;navigate the <strong>Network Adapters</strong> section and find the connection that needs a change of MAC address. Since the wired and wireless networking components of your PC are separate, they'll have different addresses, so make sure to pick the correct one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/device-manager.jpg><p>Double-click on the desired device and you'll open a new window pertaining to that specific component. Head to the Advanced tab and scroll down the list of options under the Property heading until you find <strong>Network Address</strong>. It might also be referred to as <strong>Locally Administered Address</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/network-address.jpg><p>Change the radio dialog from <strong>Not Present</strong> to <strong>Value</strong> and type in your new MAC address in the corresponding field, then press <strong>OK</strong> to apply. To check your work, you can open a Command Prompt and type in "getmac" to return all addresses tied to your system.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/getmac.jpg><h2 id=how-to-use-a-mac-address-generator>How to Use a MAC Address Generator</h2><p>Sometimes, a network adapter won't let you use the simple method above to change your MAC address. In these cases, the best course of action is to use a MAC address generator, sometimes referred to as a MAC address changer.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NoVirusThanks MAC Address Changer</a></strong> is a free utility that can change the MAC address of your network adapter to either a specified string, or a randomized result. It's got a nice, clean UI that's free from clutter — the focus here is doing one straightforward job well, so it's a great option&nbsp;for anyone who's not completely confident with this kind of task.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/mac-address-changer.jpg><p>Alternatively, more well-versed users might find that <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Technitium MAC Address Changer</a></strong> is a better solution. Its extra options might look a little&nbsp;intimidating, but they all have their uses, and don't distract too much if you're just looking to make a quick address switch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/technitium.jpg><h2 id=changing-your-mac-address-is-easy>Changing Your MAC Address Is Easy</h2><p>The MAC address is an often neglected part of your digital identity.
