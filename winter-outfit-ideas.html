This year, though, I’m prepping in advance by collecting a ton of outfit inspo from all my fave influencers, so that I can refer to (and copy) their cutest looks without having to think much about it.</p><p>One of my faves in the <a href=# id=auto-tag_winter-fashion data-tag=winter-fashion>winter fashion</a> game? Illinois native <a href=# rel=nofollow>Tricia Stoecklin</a>, a plus-size fashionista with the wardrobe of my dreams. Stoecklin isn’t one to show out in over-the-top pieces, though; her wardrobe of neutral, elevated basics is perfect for building stylish, minimalist looks that are still playful and cool.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>“My style is very neutral in color, but i’m a huge lover of textures,” shares Stoecklin. While I turn to women like Stoecklin for my winter <a href=# id=auto-tag_outfit-ideas data-tag=outfit-ideas>outfit ideas</a>, she shares how she’s able to get inspo of her own: “I get <a href=#>so much fashion inspiration</a> from the seasons, social media and Pinterest, and I love even using makeup to drive me to create fun outfits.” As someone who always does their glam before selecting a look, I couldn’t agree more.</p><p>So, what does Stoecklin clock as winter 2021’s top looks? “The trends for winter I’m most looking forward to are shackets, all-over neutral and warm tones, chunky boots and styling <a href=#>loungewear as streetwear</a>.”</p><p>Yes, yes, a thousand times, yes! And whether you’re plus-size or straight size, Stoecklin’s go-to looks will serve as the perfect dose of cold-weather fashion inspo. To see her favorite trends in action, check out her top three winter outfit ideas below, and refer back next time you’re stuck on what to wear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/winter-outfit-ideas3.jpeg><h2>Chunky Knits + Chunky Boots</h2><p>When it comes to <a href=#>knitwear and cute boots</a>, double the chunk = double the fun! “Incorporating warm tones and chunky boots are winter style must-haves for me,” says Stoecklin. “I love bringing an edgy and feminine vibe to the outfits I create.”</p><p>“By having the a-line skirt and a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>soft sweater</a> (mine are both from Eloquii) contrast with the edginess of the chunky leather boots by Dr. Martens, this look brings two different styles into one, which is what I love to do most,” she says.</p><h2></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/winter-outfit-ideas2.jpeg><h2>Cozy Shacket + Loungewear</h2><p>“Who said loungewear can’t be worn out of the house?” Stoecklin asks. “I am on a mission to rock my loungewear at all times. Why not be comfy and still be stylish?” Stoecklin recommends one key piece layered overtop of any sweater and leggings to elevate the look: <a href=# rel=nofollow>the shacket</a>, or shirt-jacket.</p><p>“I dove into <a href=#>the world of shackets</a>, which is a shirt thick enough to be a jacket, and it’s a great way to style up any outfit,” she explains, adding, “To elevate your loungewear even more, tossing on some jewelry takes your look from cozy around the house to streetwear goals.”</p><h2></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/winter-outfit-ideas1.jpeg><h2>Patterned Dress + Neutral Layers</h2><p>In the (heavily adjusted) words of Elle Woods, whoever said neutrals were boring was seriously disturbed. “I’m keeping it neutral with this look, but not boring,” says Stoecklin. “Adding a fun patterned dress and neutral layering pieces like <a href=# rel=nofollow>a camel coat</a> and bone wide-brim hat really grabs the eye.”</p><p>There are two ways to rock this look: a fun pattern with neutral layers, or vibrant layers with a neutral-patterned piece to ground it all.&nbsp;“If you’re a little nervous about wearing bold colors, a neutral pattern is a great place to <a href=#>bring visual interest</a> to a look,” says Stoecklin.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/banner-newsletter_july2020.jpg alt="StyleCaster newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ywwdOfoK1lmZmyor%2BOa2hvaGdsfLi1za2cq2WfqsGntdNmoJ2dkah8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-burke.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Chris Burke dating?
