On the surface, it looked shallow, but I came to see she needs these shoes to project confidence, they are part of her outside skin. That’s the real world,” Dr. Sadrieh says in the piece.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dimples.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/VOS-Body.jpeg><p>He describes a foreign-sounding combination of procedures that he came to call, collectively, the “Cinderella” surgery: <a href=# rel=nofollow>hallux valgus correction</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>osteotomy</a>, and <a href=# rel=nofollow>screw fixation</a>. He’s also coined three other surgeries: the Perfect 10 (aesthetic toe-shortening), the Model T (toe lengthening), and the Foot Tuck, a “fat pad augmentation” that Dr. Safrieh says “helps with high heels.”</p><p>And he’s not the only one; there’s a Manhattan-based surgeon named Dr. Neal Blitz who also performs these procedures. “My practice has exploded because of<strong> Manolo Blahnik, Christian Louboutin and Nicholas Kirkwood</strong>,” he says bluntly. Wow.</p><p>To all this, we say: what?&nbsp;This reminds us of the ancient Chinese tradition of foot binding, by which women make their feet really tiny over many years of painfully wrapping their feet to constrict growth. And now that much more comfortable shoes are&nbsp; on-trend—sneakers, Birkenstocks, pool slides, and beyond—will this foot surgery trend keep an upward trend or will it dive off a bit?</p><p>Would you ever get surgery to re-shape your foot for a pair of shoes?
