"After she and her personal assistant were unable to open the door to the upstairs bedroom/office, the assistant telephoned 911."</p><p>Jacobs' toxicology results revealed no drugs in his system at the time of his death.</p><p>“Adult white male with a history of pseudoseizures, gastrointestinal bleeding, elevated liver enzymes, and chronic alcohol use suffered a self-inflicted shotgun wound," his autopsy states.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Healthline.com</a>, a pseudoseizure, or Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizure (PNES), mimics the physical symptoms of an epileptic seizure, but is caused by underlying psychological conditions in most cases, though physical conditions including low blood sugar or fainting with jerking (convulsive syncope) can also trigger an event.</p><p>Kellie Pickler rose to fame as a contestant on <a href=#>American Idol</a> in 2006, and she released her debut country album, Small Town Girl, later that year. She's scored a string of country hits including "Red High Heels," "I Wonder" and "Best Days of Your Life," a duet with <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>. Pickler also co-hosted the talk show Pickler & Ben for two seasons, and she won Season 16 of Dancing With the Stars in 2013.</p><p>Pickler and Jacobs married in January of 2011. The couple starred together in a reality show, I Love Kellie Pickler, that ran on CMT for three seasons. Pickler accepted a job as a DJ on SiriusXM the Highway in 2022, but she <a href=#>departed</a> that gig in late March of 2023. She has been silent on social media and has not commented publicly on Jacobs' death.</p><p>Jacobs made his <a href=#>final post to social media</a> on Feb. 15 to mark the success of <a href=#>Lee Brice</a>'s latest album, Hey World, which had been certified Platinum. Jacobs co-wrote several songs on the album, and he also co-produced the project, as well as playing acoustic guitar and singing background vocals.</p><p>Jacobs also wrote <a href=#>Garth Brooks</a>' "More Than a Memory" and <a href=#>Eli Young Band</a>'s "Dust," among many other songs.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>20 Incredible Country Songs Written by Kyle Jacobs</h2><p>Take a look back at some of the best cuts from singer-songwriter Kyle Jacobs' country music songbook.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpJ2cobamec%2BimqSklad6qcHSm5innF2gxq2xjKOYnKeSqHqiwdOop6yxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michelle-mangan.html><span>←</span><span>What is Michelle Mangan Net Worth 2022?
