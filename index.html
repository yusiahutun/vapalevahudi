Paolina RussoJames CochraneIt didn’t take long for Paolina Russo’s forward-looking knitwear to make waves in fashion’s inner circles. With just a few seasons under its woven belts and cutout ribbed knit dresses, the label has already been named a finalist for the 2023 Woolmark prize and awarded the inaugural Zalando Visionary Award in partnership with Copenhagen Fashion Week. The early hype is earned: Combining references as disparate as French folklore, youth recreational soccer, cave drawings, and early-’00s spinning top toys known as Beyblades, Russo and co-founder Lucile Guilmard create techy knitted separates and soccer-cleat-studded corsets that cleverly merge their personal pasts with the future of fashion.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Faye Resnick's Marriage, Divorce, Husband Plus Gay Speculations</h2><time>Oct 9, 2024</time>

Mulberry House may be a work-in-progress refurbishment but that doesn’t stop owners Leah and Rupert Lane from pulling out all the stops for Christmas. From the first week in December, this Georgian farmhouse becomes a hive of making, baking and creating – gathering greenery from the garden, crafting homemade decorations, crowd-cooking mince pies and, of course, decking the tree. “When we finally get it into the house we dress it together as a family,” says Leah, with festive songs on the radio and a sneaky Side Car cocktail for the grown-ups.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The Rising Southern Artist &amp;amp; Illustrator Laurel Mercantile</h2><time>Oct 9, 2024</time>
