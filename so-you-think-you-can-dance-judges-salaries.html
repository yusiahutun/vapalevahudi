In court documents obtained by&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>, Holker filed a a California Spousal Property Petition in the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles County, which is standard procedure when spouses die without a will. According to People, though California law states that a surviving spouse is entitled to half of their deceased spouse’s joint estate once they’re dead, the living spouse still has to file the petition to prove they are actually the spouse of the person who died. Holker asked for “determination of property passing to the surviving spouse” as well as “confirmation of property belonging to the surviving spouse.” The court documents detailed property, including quasi-community property, that Holker asked the court to rule she will receive as tWitch’s surviving spouse.&nbsp;“This includes any interest in a trade or business name of any unincorporated business or an interest in any unincorporated business that the deceased partner was operating or managing at the time of death,” court documents state.</p><p>Holker did not request for administration over tWitch’s estate. In the court documents, Holker alsoreported that tWitch had a “nil” net worth and that he didn’t receive any property through a gift, joint tenancy, life insurance or other beneficiaries after they married on December 10, 2023. The court documents also confirmed that tWitch lived in California throughout his whole marriage to Holker and that they didn’t have any written agreements between them on how their properties would be divided if one of them died. Along with half of their joint estate, Holker also requested half of tWitch’s Stephen Boss Productions company and Goldman Sachs investment account, as well as his royalties from Cast and Crew Production Services; Disney Worldwide Services, Inc.; GEP Talent Services, LLC; and SAG/AFTRA, according to the court documents.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.9375><h2>Maksim Chmerkovskiy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/maksim-chmerkovskiy.jpg><p>Net Worth:<br>Season: 18</p><p>Maksim Chmerkovskiy’s net worth is estimated to be around $8 Million according to <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/maksim-chmerkovskiy-net-worth/>Celebrity Net Worth.</a> Chmerkovskiy was a professional dancer on Dancing With The Stars from 2006 to 2017.
