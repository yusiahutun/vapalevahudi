Chanthaburi, about 250km (155 miles) to the southeast of Bangkok, near the Cambodian border, is gaining a reputation as a weekend retreat from the capital, but I am happy to be visiting while only a few tourists stalk the sites.
Chanthaburi is an ideal size for those who like to get acquainted with a place on foot – after a coffee."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It is a reminder that for 500 years, the sapphires and rubies that streaked east Thailand’s hills and mountains drew fortune hunters from China, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam – the seeds of a population that is unusually cosmopolitan for a provincial Thai town.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One thread of Chanthaburi’s ethnic tapestry can be unpicked upstream, along the river’s promenade, where Chinese temples stand on either side of the water.

I take a seat on the terrace of a restaurant called Taste, which looks across at the Chantaboon riverfront.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taste serves Italian fare, and offers another expression of Chanthaburi’s cosmopolitan character.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/01/09/86b4c063-3732-44f7-9595-5d48ac8fa68e_58dda525.jpg>“I’m half <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Chinese Hakka</span></a> and a Catholic,” says the owner. “I studied in Italy but wanted to come back; I’m proud of my hometown.
