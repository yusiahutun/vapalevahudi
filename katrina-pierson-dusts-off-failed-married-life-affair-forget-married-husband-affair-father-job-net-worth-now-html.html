She wrote,</p><p>How does one "secretly" dine at the #TRUMP hotel??&nbsp; #MAGA</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Similarly, talking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Gossip Cop</a>, Katrina cleared the air regarding the speculations made between Anthony and her. When asked about the truth behind the relationship rumors, Katrina stated, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“We are NOT dating.Never dated, won’t be dating. We are political friends and media colleagues.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the next day after the duo was spotted having dinner, Anthony&nbsp;was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;to be dating another lady, a FOX News anchor Kimberly Guilfoyle, which finally settled down the matter between Katrina and Anthony.</p><p>Talking about Katrina's past marital affairs, she was previously&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a> to a guy named Christopher Pierson in 1997, a year after giving birth to their son in 1996. However, the two&nbsp;divorced just three months after tying knots, and the reason behind the split remains confined.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She had struggled through a lengthy court conflict with her ex-husband over custody of their son.&nbsp;She even&nbsp;accused the judge in her custody case of having a political bias against her!</p><p>But that&nbsp;was what her past held. As of now, Katrina has not been encountered romantically with anyone. She possibly might be dating somebody out of the limelight, but that's just a mere speculation until Katrina sheds light on the subject.</p><h2>More About Katrina Pierson</h2><p>Katrina Pierson, 41, who serves as the national spokeswoman<a href=# rel=follow> for Donald Trump's presidential campaign</a>, was born on July 20, 1976, in Kansas, United States of America. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Talking about her family, she belonged to a lower middle-class family including her&nbsp;African father and an American mother.
