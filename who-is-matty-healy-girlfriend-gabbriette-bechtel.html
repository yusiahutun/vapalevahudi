As for the 1975 singer, he’s in his own new relationship as well, with model and musician <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/gabbriette/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gabbriette Bechtel" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gabbriette Bechtel</a>, who often simply goes by the mononym Gabbriette.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Healy and Bechtel have made a few public appearances together, and they’ve been linked since the fall of 2023. So who exactly is Bechtel, and how did they meet? Here’s everything we know.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Gabbriette has been modeling since she graduated from high school.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bechtel is a well-established model, who has appeared on the cover of magazines such as HommeGirls, in campaigns for brands like Ferragamo and Paris Texas, and on the runway for labels like Diesel. She is currently <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.imgmodels.com/los-angeles/talent/7029-gabbriette data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="signed by IMG Models" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">signed by IMG Models</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.vogue.com/article/model-chef-gabbriette-bechtel data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said in an interview in 2023" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said in an interview in 2023</a> that it had not been an easy road to success. “I was an unpaid, hardworking model for a very long time,” she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the same interview, Bechtel talked about growing up in California, where she faced racism based on her looks. “The majority of students at my high school were beautiful, strictly white blonde girls, and my sister and I were Hispanic,” she said. “I was called some pretty awful things. But then I just learned to laugh at it.”</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She originally wanted to pursue dance.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although she has found her greatest success as a model, Bechtel originally moved to Los Angeles after high school in an effort to become a ballet dancer. “I was convinced I was going to be a professional ballerina, and I still am,” she said in the 2023 interview.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/gabbriette-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Highsnobiety class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Highsnobiety</a>, “I thought I was going to apply to Juilliard. I thought I was going to be on So You Think You Can Dance and be a choreographer and be in music videos.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In fact, as one of her first major gigs, the Orange County native was cast as a dancer in a Blood Orange music video. However, she didn’t end up making the final cut. “We had a few fun days of rehearsal and started to film the music video, and then I got a call that I was cut,” she told Highsnobiety. “I didn’t make it into the music video, but I did all of the rehearsals, and I think my feet are in it at some point.” She also nabbed more music-video gigs, eventually earning her attention from modeling agencies.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Charli XCX made her part of a punk girl group.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As if the talents we’ve already mentioned weren’t impressive enough, Bechtel also has a career in music, and she’s released three EPs—Season 1 (2019), Season 2 (2020), and The Movie (2021)—as part of the band Nasty Cherry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The group, which also features members Chloe Chaidez, Debbie Knox-Hewson, and Georgia Somary, was put together by pop singer Charli XCX, The X Factor style. The process was documented in the reality series I’m With the Band: Nasty Cherry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2019, Bechtel <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a29846619/nasty-cherry-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="talked with Bazaar" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">talked with Bazaar</a> about the band, saying, “We definitely feel like a family at this point.” She also explained how she came to be a part of the group. “Charli reached out to me, and I worked with her a while ago, maybe two or three years ago on a music video, and I just kind of remember her being a light, and we kept in contact,” she said. “I already had that trust with her. I feel like I’ve been saying this a lot, but I say yes to a lot of creative things. I’m down to do new things, work with new people, whatever it is. But I’ve really never done music. And I thought, ‘Why the hell not?’”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She has dabbled in fashion design.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thanks to her modeling career, Bechtel has had plenty of exposure to the fashion world, and she actually dabbled in design by collaborating with R&M Leathers on a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://randmleathers.bigcartel.com/product/r-m-x-gabriette data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="special apron" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">special apron</a> (which was first available in the fall of 2023, but might be getting a restock, as the website notes the product is “coming soon”).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A link to the apron can be found in the bio of Bechtel’s Instagram, and when you visit the product listing, it reads: “Leather apron designed in collaboration with Gabbriette. Made with a supple and sturdy cowhide this piece is both practical and aesthetic. Style falls to the mid thigh and has belted detail which is fully adjustable on both the waist and neck. Features a heart pocket with silver tone stud detail.”</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Oh, and she loves cooking.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scroll through Bechtel’s Instagram, and in between the many modeling photos, you might find a cooking video here and there, because the model loves to play home chef.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We ate dinner together as a family every single night, so there was always a fresh meal. We never had takeout,” she told Highsnobiety about first developing her love for food. “We had a lot of Bon Appétit magazines lying around, so [my mother] would always try new recipes. I would come home and she’d have it open and be like, ‘I’m making this tonight,’ and she’d nail it. I would help her prep, so I grew up with my mom testing out stuff.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the COVID-19 pandemic, a few of Bechtel’s cooking videos went viral, including one in which she remade Erewhon’s beloved vegan blackout cake. You can find the model’s recipe <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CsIJjCXteWd/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=here class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">here</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">She likely met Matty through matchmaking.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although it’s unclear how exactly the musical pair met, some outlets like The List and Grazia Daily have theorized that the couple were introduced by Charli XCX.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Due to Bechtel’s close relationship with the “Break the Rules” singer, it’s suggested that she was probably introduced to Healy through the pop star, who is engaged to the 1975 drummer George Daniel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bechtel and Healy were first connected in September 2023, when they were spotted kissing in New York. That same month, the pair were spotted at a few Fashion Week events, and Bechtel even shared a video to her Instagram Story from one of Healy’s concerts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When asked about internet trolls who leave comments based on her relationship with Healy, the model <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/gabbriette-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=said class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">said</a>, “I don’t give a shit. I think it’s hilarious. Go for it. Have fun. People have a lot to say.…You don’t know me at all.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
