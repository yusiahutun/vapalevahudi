Well, not&nbsp;always---sometimes having too much screen real estate can lead to more distractions. And distractions are the antithesis of "getting things done."</p><p>That's why having a sometimes-on, optional second (or third) display can be a godsend when you need it, and a TV is the perfect option for that. You can use it as an auxiliary display when you need it, an excellent movie-watching platform when you want it, and a great way to game on a bigger screen during your downtime. It's a win-win-win.&nbsp;I recently added a TV to my computer setup, and it's one of the most useful things I've ever done for exactly these reasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The best part is that if you pick the right TV, it will be sort of "always on"---even when it's turned off, it's still sipping power so your computer will still see it as turned on and connected. Why is that a big deal? Because when you disconnect a screen from your computer (even just turning it off), the GPU will reconfigure the other screens to offset the change. That is&nbsp;exceptionally annoying if you're looking for a sometimes-on display.</p><p>So for that type of setup, a TV is the perfect answer.</p><h2 id=how-to-pick-the-right-tv>How to Pick the Right TV</h2><p>If you're looking to add a TV to your computer setup, you don't have to get the biggest, best, or nicest TV out there---unless you just want to, of course. But if this isn't going to be your "main" TV, there isn't much reason to spend a lot of money on it. You also don't need something as super-crisp as a good PC monitor because it's going to be serving auxiliary duty.</p><p>I'm using a <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">39-inch Insignia Roku TV</a> that I picked up at Best Buy for a couple hundred bucks. If you're looking for something similar and don't want to deal with Best Buy, this <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">40-inch TCL Roku TV on Amazon</a> is also a killer option.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are, however, some things to consider.</p><h3 id=display-resolution-keep-it-modest-for-simplicity-s-sake><strong>Display Resolution: Keep it Modest, for Simplicity's Sake</strong></h3><p>If you're looking to use a TV as a second or third monitor, then display resolution is going to be crucial. While Windows has come a long way when it comes to handling ultra high resolution display, it still may not be the best idea to go with a 4K panel---especially if your existing monitor(s) is running at a lower resolution.</p><p>This will just keep things simple when it comes to configuring your newly-added display and keep things clean when it comes to turning it on and off if you don't plan on using it full time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3753.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, for example, when I was looking for a new screen to add to my existing setup, I knew I wanted a 1080p display. I currently have two monitors that I use full-time, and they're both 1080p, so adding a TV with the same resolution only made sense.</p><p>This way, there's no adjustment when I need to add the third screen to my workflow. I turn it on, drag whatever I need to it, and it just works. It's simple.</p><p>Of course, you also have to consider your intended use. If your GPU can handle it and you want something higher resolution for gaming, then by all means: grab a 4K screen and have the time of your life with those high-res texture packs.</p><h3 id=connections-hdmi-cec-and-the-like>Connections: HDMI, CEC, and the Like</h3><p>You're going to want to make sure the TV has enough HDMI ports for your needs---especially if this is going to be a multi-use system. If you're going to add it to a computer but also want it for other reasons---like console gaming, for example---you'll want it to have the proper port support for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The good news it that most modern TVs should have at least a couple of HDMI ports---probably even more. These should also have <a href=#>HDMI CEC</a>, which may or may not be that important to you. Again, it all relates to how you plan on using the screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Enable HDMI-CEC on Your TV, and Why You Should</a></span></p><h2 id=mounting-options-placement-of-your-screen-is-important>Mounting Options: Placement of Your Screen is Important</h2><p>Placing your TV depends on your current system setup and how much room you have, but most people probably don't have room on their desk for a TV. In that case, mounting it to a wall near your PC is&nbsp;the way to go.</p><p>For my setup, I have the TV mounted to the wall adjacent to my PC. It's mounted to <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">an articulating arm</a>, which allows me to use it in a variety of scenarios.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3757.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For example, if I'm watching a livestream of some sort that I need to follow closely, I can pull the screen away from the wall and closer to my monitors. It's still a slight head turn away, but it's not hard to keep an eye on while also doing other things.</p><p>On the other side of that, I can also use it as a passive screen that only shows information I want to see sometimes---like weather, currently playing music, or the like. The TV screen also works as my "hobby screen" when I need it to. I play guitar, so I throw guitar tablature on my screen when learning new songs, making it easy to follow along.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_3744.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's definitely a multi-use setup, so the articulating wall mount makes the most out of it for me. But you could go in a couple of different directions with this---if your screen will be next to your existing screen(s), then there's no reason to go with a flat wall mount. If your desk is big enough, you could even do an articulated mounting arm---just make sure it can handle a big screen like a TV.</p><p>While adding a TV screen to your PC setup may not be something you've considered, the practical application here is pretty vast. You can get a very large screen for not a lot of money, use it when you need it and tuck it away when you don't, and just overall have a very cool setup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhqbmtmbIVww8eyZLKnpWLAqbvUpZtmm5%2BjwKqwxKugp59dlrGltc2gZJplpKt6tbuMsqauql2YvK681K2cq2WjmsG2vI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./william-katt.html><span>←</span><span>Who is William Katt dating?
