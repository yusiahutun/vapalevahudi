Ben is the creator of Feedbin, my preferred <a href=#>RSS service</a>. I say “service” and not “reader” because while I sometimes use Feedbin itself as a reader (it’s good), I also bounce around to other readers for fun. The API they offer enables this, which is a godsend. Right now I’m using a lot of NetNewsWire on my non-mobile machines, but ultimately it’s Feedbin under the hood syncing my read items and favorites and whatnot.</p><p>Adam Stacoviak mentioned that while he’s a Feedbin subscriber, he’s not much of an RSS user. They dig into why that might be in the show and it’s really interesting. Adam lists off a bunch of sites he’s got in there, and the problem sounds like the sites themselves. While it’s great the sites offer RSS and all, there is a bunch of “firehose” style news sites, with a signal/noise ratio that is not great for any one reader. Don’t subscribe to sites that do news as a business, was part of the advice, and I like that.</p><p>The “sweet spot” they honed in on is sites that publish more like weekly or monthly. So your RSS reader is kind of a catcher for less-oft published articles. That’s almost tough to hear as an RSS lover, because a little machine to catch random articles you might miss is quite a niche thing. No wonder RSS never seems to be able to take off.</p><p>I think I’d widen that sweet spot to even daily or multi-daily publishing sites, but if you’re getting to 5x and above daily, it’s too much for a good RSS experience. I’ve never been able to put my finger on that, but now I think that’s it.</p><p>I’ve had a draft post “Should we be able to pause an RSS feed as a reader?” for a while, but I’m deleting it now. That’s a niche feature for a thing that is already niche. If a feed is overwhelming to you, it’s unsubscribe town. Pausing isn’t an answer. If any publishers out there agree, I think an answer might be an RSS feed that is somehow trimmed down. A best-of-the-week collection, perhaps.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpa2dgbXxygY6srp6dpGLAsbvTZp2oql2nwLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./reinhold-ferdinand-engelhardt-and-margaretta-jane-debus.html><span>←</span><span>Reinhold Ferdinand Engelhardt and Margaretta Jane Debus</span></a>
