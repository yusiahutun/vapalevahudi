Some scenes show the group rolling through desert highways and into cities in a ‘70s-inspired yellow van, complete with a red stripe down the side and fuzzy dice hanging from the rearview mirror. All gassed up and instruments in hand, the gang kick up dust and make it to their next venue before hopping onstage to perform.</p><p>There’s nothing glamorous about packing your whole band into a van, but once onstage, the guys live out their rock star fantasies, performing under bright lights to a packed audience of screaming fans.</p><p>Through it all, the band mates find themselves surrounded by hazes of dust and smoke — a hat tip to the song’s many allusions to smoking weed.</p><p>Nickelback’s road-inspired new music video is based on reality: The group are currently on their Get Rollin’ Tour, a trek featuring rock-friendly country star <a href=#>Brantley Gilbert </a>as their opening act. The tour made a stop at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena in August, where their star-packed set proved the band’s appeal to a country audience. <a href=#>Jason Aldean</a>, <a href=#>Jelly Roll </a>and <a href=#>Bailey Zimmerman</a> were just a few of the country star pals who turned out to make the show even more special.</p><p>The "High Time" video was directed by Timothy Hiehle, who also filmed the clip alongside Austin Friedline, Peter Hoang, Ryan Mclemore and Tanner Gallagher. The band also extended special thanks to assistant Alan Lopez for work on the video.</p><p>Released last November, “High Time” is a tribute to life on the road&nbsp;— and the, ahem, recreational pastimes the travelers enjoy in their downtime. The song is on the track list of Nickelback’s latest album, Get Rollin’.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>15 Country Artists Who Deserve to Be in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</h2><p>With Dolly Parton's 2022 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame — and, even more recently, Willie Nelson's nomination for the 2023 class — it's clearer than ever that country artists have a place in the Cleveland-based institution's hallowed halls. But the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame has always shown love to country performers, to a certain extent: Johnny Cash, Chet Akins, Brenda Lee, the Everly Brothers and Hank Williams are all past inductees.</p><p>Based on the criteria the Hall has set forth, that nominees should be acts who have had "a profound impact on youth culture," there are still many more country artists who deserve their spot in the Hall. Flip through the gallery below to see Taste of Country's top picks for who the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame should induct next.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>35 Songs That Prove Country and Rock Music Go Hand in Hand</h2><p>With Dolly Parton's recent induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the country and rock genres are closer than ever before — but she's far from the first country artist to venture into rock territory, or vice versa. Here are 35 songs that show just how great the musical crossover between country and rock can be.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>PICTURES: See Inside Kid Rock's Luxurious Childhood Home</h2><p>Kid Rock has a rough-and-tumble image, but he didn't exactly grow up in humble circumstances. His childhood home was a 5,660-square-foot luxury home in Michigan, situated on 5.5 acres that includes 5 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, 5-car garage, along with a partially finished walkout and guest house. There's also a 3 stall horse barn, regulation tennis court and inground pool. The 22-room house was renovated in 2004, and it also has a hot tub and a wet bar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmp6GToLKtrsCcomagmZy1bsDIppxmrpmZsrB7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tongs-sweet-fashion-bomb-founders-liushu-lei-and-yutong-jiang-shanghai-based-brand.html><span>←</span><span>Inside Shushu/Tongs sweet fashion bomb with founders Liushu Lei and Yutong Jiang: the Shanghai-ba</span></a>
