It used to be a luxury of the elites of the distant past. Though the concept of the use of aroma for therapeutic purposes exists since first century, but over the recent years, there is an increase in the interest for Aromatherapy. This is because people have started to realise that essential oils act as medication for mind, mood and emotion. Originally, all medications were natural and people used Ayurveda and essentials oils as mode of medication. Due to capitalisation, industrialisation and the sole good of the pharmaceutical companies to earn easy cash, cheap and artificial chemicals and ingredients are being used. With past revising itself, now there is a major shift in emphasis from these chemical cocktails to natural treatments. Incorporation of aromatherapy into the designed psychotherapies is being realised as an important part of holistic therapy.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/laravel-filemanager/photos/662/How%20do%20fragrances%20work%20on%20human%20psyche2.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Essential oils enhance both health and mood. These oils either be applied on the surface or inhaled. This can be done by either diffusing the oil or by applying it on your clothes or as a linen spray. Essential oils can also be applied directly to the skin but it has to be mixed with a carrier oil first. When we inhale the fragrance the molecules of the essential oil immediately interacts with the olfactory organs, the respiratory system and the brain. During inhalation, these molecules go to the receptor system, which is the limbic system that acts as the emotional brain. This system contributes to control blood pressure, stress, hormonal balance etc. This connection explains why a certain scent elicits a certain emotion.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.psychologs.com/laravel-filemanager/photos/662/How%20do%20fragrances%20work%20on%20human%20psyche3.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Mind and body have a strong connection in a way that one is bound to effect the other.
