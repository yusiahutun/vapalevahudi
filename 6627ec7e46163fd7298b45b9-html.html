I thought it sounded gross."</p><p>The actress did not want to reveal more information about the ordeal, keeping the name of the film and the year in which it happened to herself.</p><p>Although, she did want to make it clear that she did not believe it was something done with bad intentions, but that it was a different era in which such tests were not looked down upon like they are today.</p><p>"I was very young and was terribly aware of how easy it was to lose everything by being labeled as difficult, so I pretended to be excited and went ahead," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/04/23/17138871196229.png><p>"It was not a power game, no one was trying to be horrible to me or hurt me. It was just a very different time and we've learned."</p><p>On the other hand, the actress also wanted to emphasize that things are very different now, something that can be seen in 'The Idea of You', her next film, in which she has also performed the duties of producer.</p><p>In fact, in this film, the 'chemistry test' was based on music, explaining: "We asked each actor to choose a song that they thought their character would like and then we did a little improvisation.</p><p>"I was sitting in a chair, as if we had just come from a dinner or a walk, we would press play, and we would start dancing together."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6mpq%2Bhlah8c3yRbWZpbF9ngHCClWtunptnmoF3fZVsnZ1vYm6Fo4CUm3BnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andre-ayew.html><span>←</span><span>Andre Ayew</span></a>
