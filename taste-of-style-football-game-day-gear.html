Country stars like <a href=#>Tim McGraw</a> and <a href=#>Thomas Rhett</a> sure are! Some of Music City's top stars are just as passionate about college football as they are about their music, and they sport their college team colors with pride!</p><p>Whether cheering on their favorite SEC (or Sun Belt) team or reppin' on the red carpet, country's finest don helmets, jerseys and hats to support their faves. McGraw showed off his Tiger spirit alongside another big star, <a href=#>Kenny Chesney</a>&nbsp;proved he's a proud member of Vol Nation, and <a href=#>Sara Evans</a> rooted for Mizzou.</p><p>Of course, one Georgia boy showed off his Bulldog pride in a big way. That earned him our Fashion Diva of the Week title this week. After all, it takes a true fan to rock an almost entire team uniform. Check out these photo highlights and more in this week's Taste of Style!</p><p><h3>Sara Evans - University of Missouri</h3></p><p>Evans seems torn on which team to pull for sometimes, since her husband, Jay Barker, is an ex-University of Alabama quarterback and national championship winner and she's a proud University of Missouri fan.</p><p>In this photo, the singer is decked out in black and gold for her SEC team. She's not only wearing a bright yellow Mizzou sweatshirt, but she paired it with a Missouri beanie! It's a cute look for the cooler fall temps that are coming our way.</p><p><h3><span>Tim McGraw - Louisiana State University&nbsp;</span></h3></p><figure class="img-tag alignleft"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Tim McGraw LSU</span></p>Rick Diamond, Getty Images<p>loading...</p></figure><p>McGraw, a Louisiana native, loves purple and lives gold. Although he didn't attend LSU, he still enjoys the Baton Rouge school and loves wearing purple to support the Tigers. While in New Orleans, the 47-year-old posed with another big name -- Saints quarterback Drew Brees.</p><p>In the photo, McGraw sports a skintight vintage LSU Tigers shirt. His soft tee is an Original Retro Brand shirt with Mike the Tiger's face next to the LSU logo. The singer pairs the vintage shirt with tight dark denim jeans and wears a well-worn black cowboy hat on his head. McGraw's <a href=#>hats</a> are a staple, and he has to get them just right before he can wear them. We'd say this one is a perfect 10.</p><p>As McGraw would say: Geaux tigers!</p><p><h3>Kenny Chesney - University of Tennessee</h3></p><p>Avid football fan Chesney doesn't hide his Orange pride! The 'American Kids' singer's blood is so orange, he's even friends with the school's famous ex-quarterback, Peyton Manning. Chesney has been a member of Vols Nation for a long time --&nbsp; he is frequently seen sporting the power T.</p><p>Before playing his recent show at Flora-Bama, Chesney did soundcheck in his favorite color. He wore an orange and white ball cap that payed tribute to his other true love: Tennessee football. We bet Chesney's excited it's football time in Tennessee!</p><p><h3>Jason Aldean - University of Georgia</h3></p><p><a href=#>Jason Aldean</a>&nbsp;is one of many country artists who yell "Go Dawgs" on Saturdays in the fall. He's also made a rapper pal who supports the Georgia Bulldogs.&nbsp;<a href=#>Ludacris</a>, who joined Aldean for the 'Dirt Road Anthem (Remix),' performed on stage with the country singer and they both opted for red and white attire.</p><p>Aldean wore a Georgia Bulldogs T-shirt with Uga's adorable face right smack dab in the middle. The tight tee showed the singer's fit stomach, and he paired it with equally tight jeans. Who said sports can't be sexy?! Aldean's pal, Luda, also showed off his school pride in a black Georgia jacket with grey sleeves.</p><p>Even if you're not a UGA fan, this photo may have you cheering them on with the rest of the Athens crowd.</p><p><h3>Cole Swindell - Georgia Southern University</h3></p><figure class="img-tag alignleft"><p><span class=visually-hidden>Cole Swindell Hat</span></p>Michael Loccisano, Getty Images<p>loading...</p></figure><p><a href=#>Cole Swindell</a> proudly reps his home state and his alma mater when it comes to college football. The singer hails from Georgia and is a Georgia Southern University graduate as of 2007 -- hence the 'GS' on his ball cap. The hat has become a staple of the 31-year-old's look, and he even wears it while on the red carpet. Here, he's walking the carpet at the 2014 CMT Awards with the cap on his head. His hat has become such a part of him (and possibly a good luck charm?!) that he recently wrote about forgetting it. "Welp," he <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "Left my Georgia Southern hat in Nashville. Guess I'll be rocking a Braves hat for these shows. #smoothmove"</p><p>We'll cheer on the Eagles and do the tomahawk chop with you, Cole, since you look darn&nbsp;good in a baseball cap!</p><p><span>This Week's Fashion Diva: Thomas Rhett - University of Georgia</span></p><p>Thomas Rhett is a Georgia native and a very proud Bulldog (he's also no stranger to Taste of Style)! Rhett is this week's Fashion Diva based on sheer dedication alone. He has so many great photos in UGA gear that we cheated and added two!</p><p>In the first pic, Rhett is as handsome as ever in a short-sleeved, red collared Nike shirt. The left side of his chest showed the school's big G, and he's proudly holding a hedge the university gave him to commemorate his No. 1 fandom. That smile says it all! He's one happy man.</p><p>Then, the 'Something to Do With My Hands' singer prepped for opening weekend. Standing a little too close to the TV, he looks ready to take the field himself. He's wearing a full helmet, but Rhett's jersey is definitely our favorite part! He's sporting a custom-made jersey with his last name on the back and the No. 3 -- even though he's No. 1 in our hearts. We bet that makes for an interesting game day in the Akins household since his wife, Lauren, is an avid Tennessee Vols fan.</p><p>We'll say it with you this week, TR: Dawgs on top!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmjqbJuu8Vmqq2xnJp6p7vOrZmapJxitKK5xGabmrFdnLKivo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-admitted-she-regretted-christmas-day-outfit-in-candid-moment-with-fan.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton admitted she regretted Christmas Day outfit in candid moment with fan</span></a>
