One of Paul Rudd's fraternity brothers just shared this amazing photo of him in a Sigma Nu composite from the '80s on Reddit yesterday -- and we are loving it.
The &#34;Ant-Man&#34; star attended the University of Kansas before making his acting debut on &#34;Sisters&#34; back in 1992, one of his few jobs before breaking out in &#34;Clueless&#34; in 1995.
&#34;Not too old, but Paul Rudd had some awesome hair when he went to the University of Kansas in the 80's,&#34;"><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
