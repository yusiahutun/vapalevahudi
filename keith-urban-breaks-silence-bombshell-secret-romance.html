The country music singer – who regularly takes to social media to share <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>insights into life</a></strong> with the Eyes Wide Shut star – revealed his thoughts on what happened in an <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Entertainment Tonight</a></strong> interview released on Sunday.</p><p id=eM_1dMimhSU2 data-wc=31>Keith was enjoying time at a <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong> concert with Nicole in mid-May when he accidentally uploaded a story to his Instagram which featured the younger couple kissing in the background.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: The moment Keith caught Phoebe and Bo kissing at Taylor's concert</figure><p id=eWtEoyXxKau9 data-wc=41>Speaking with ET's Rachel Smith at the Country Music Association's Festival in Nashville, the 55-year-old responded to the interviewer's questions about the incident by saying: "<strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Phoebe</a></strong>, I'm so sorry," before continuing lightheartedly: "You were on camera Phoebe, what were you thinking!"</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><p id=eHYYwewNZjSH data-wc=39>However, the 'You Look Good in My Shirt' singer did add: "It felt very awkward, I felt bad! We were just digging on the concert, you never know what's going to happen." Rachel commiserated, agreeing: "You had no idea."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/6a2d86a080da-keith-urban-bombshell-secret-romance-reaction.jpg><p id=eXCkmk-oAulc data-wc=59>During the interview, Keith also discussed how much he and Nicole simply enjoyed <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Taylor's concert</a></strong>, gushing: "Yeah, we had a blast, it was really good… just watching where she's ascended to as a performer, as a songwriter. Seriously, she'll be among the greatest songwriters, period. She really will be, when it's all said and done – any of them."</p><p id=ec-_fnUQ3_rk data-wc=45>The New Zealand-born Australian-American performer also opened up about his wife, explaining that "unfortunately" she wouldn't be joining him at the CMA Fest this year to support his performance from the wings. He did however agree that she would be sending "good vibes" his way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d7c75d08902d-taylorswifterafolklore.jpg><p id=eZTTKvtE6j5L data-wc=67>The Moulin Rouge actress recently <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>supported her husband</a></strong> when he took to the stage at the <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>American Country Music awards</a></strong> on May 11. The 55-year-old opened the 2023 ACM awards with a performance of his hit song 'Texas Time', and later shared a video of him and his wife of 16 years singing along to the track in a golf cart on their way to the stage.</p><p id=eyjQ7aybmTFp data-wc=90>It was also revealed later on the night by the ACMs official Instagram account that the Big Little Lies star watched her husband's performance from the wings of the stage rather than from the audience, as she proved herself ever the supportive spouse. Before Keith took to the stage, the actress, 55, also joined her musician husband on the black carpet in Frisco, Texas for the 58th iteration of one of country music's premier award shows. Both she and Keith Urban were some of the best dressed of the night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ab7ac4d4ea00-nicole-kidman-keith-urban-acm-awards.jpg><p id=edWyh5rls3sH data-wc=87>Nicole wore a brick-colored pantsuit with a tweed pattern, featuring a blazer atop wide-legged pants with a patterned hem and seemingly nothing underneath. Meanwhile, Keith kept things simple in a sleek black suit to match the carpet, wearing a button-down that he'd left open enough to show off his tattoos. The guitarist and songwriter, as is tradition, not only <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>engaged in some PDA</a></strong> with his wife on the carpet, but also stepped to the side on occasion to give her some time to shine on her own.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c21f7c09f72b-gettyimages-1486913664.jpg><p id=eSj5WU0Ebdlj data-wc=6><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
