If he gets a good run, he should be competitive.”</p><p>A winner over 1,100m in his sole start Down Under, Galaxy Patch immediately made his presence felt on his Hong Kong debut, saluting under Teetan in the Class Three Shanghai Handicap (1,200m) on October 1.</p><p>Following an unsuccessful appearance over Sha Tin’s 1,200m dirt course at the end of October, Galaxy Patch got back to winning ways on his return to turf on November 19 before impressively taking out the Class Three Lord Kanaloa Handicap (1,200m) on international day.</p><p>“He’s kept getting stronger with his wins,” Teetan said. “Last time, with the heavy weight, he got a nice run through, but just the way he quickened up and put them to sleep was really good.”</p><p>With the added burden of a 135-pound impost to contend with on the Hong Kong International Races undercard, Galaxy Patch took a keen hold before showing a clean pair of heels to finish two and three-quarter lengths ahead of runner-up The Heir.</p><p>Stopping the clock at 1:09.08, the progressive youngster took out the contest in a faster time than Lucky Sweynesse’s Group One Hong Kong Sprint (1,200m) triumph four races earlier.</p><p>Teetan and Ng have returned 12 winners from 46 runners when teaming up this term, and the Mauritian jockey is confident Galaxy Patch has a solid chance of adding to that tally if he can relax in the early stages of the contest.</p><p>“I would like him to switch off a bit more. He’s still getting used to the racing pattern in Hong Kong. Once you step up in grade, you need to relax. But I think time will tell with him,” he said.</p><p>Standing between Galaxy Patch and a fourth Hong Kong victory are eight rivals, including fellow hat-tricker seeker Gummy Gummy and four-time winner Lucky Encounter, whom Teetan highlights as his most immediate challenger.</p><p>“[Lucky Encounter] is a nice little horse but last time he travelled a bit too hard and couldn’t finish the race,” said Teetan, who has been in the saddle for all seven of Lucky Encounter’s career starts. “He’s a horse I’m going to be keeping my eyes on.”</p><p>Comments</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mq5mTnruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dH6TcWlpa1%2Blv7Cz0Z6qrKGmmnqxrdOcn2annpp6o7HArWShnaNiuKa802aenqyknruoedKtqaiml5q%2FgMHTppasp6WnsKaJxqimoKSVo7K4v9KtmKecj6yyo3LUraSYpZWZtra5nKucn52ip66tctStpJibn6PBprrTdmlpamRlfnJ%2Bha6rppeTlrqxrcigpXanlpussbjArZ2oqp0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nickelback-high-time-video.html><span>←</span><span>Nickelback Live the Rock and Roll Dream in Retro New Video</span></a>
