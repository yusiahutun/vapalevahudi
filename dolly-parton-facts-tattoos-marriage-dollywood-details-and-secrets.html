The songwriter’s big break came in 1967 when she earned a spot on </span><i><span>The Porter Wagoner Show. </span></i><span>That same year, she released her debut album, </span><i><span>Hello, I’m Dolly</span></i><span>. The world was instantly captivated by her stage presence and charming personality.</span></p><p><span>Dozens more successful albums followed with chart-topping hits like “Jolene,” “9 to 5,” “Islands in the Stream” and “Here I Am.” But Dolly’s talents weren’t just limited to music. The hitmaker is a businesswoman and a part-owner of Dollywood, a thrilling Tennessee theme park. She is also the founder of the Dollywood Foundation, a non-profit focused on childhood education initiatives.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>While the</span><i><span> I Am a Rainbow</span></i><span> author and her hubby did not welcome any <a href=#>children of their own</a>, they are very close to all of her nieces and nephews. In fact, family was just one of the inspirations behind her children’s album,</span><i><span> I Believe in You</span></i><span>, released in 2017.<br></span><span><br></span><span>“I think kids relate to me because they think of me like a Mother Goose or a Fairy Godmother,” the Grammy winner told </span><a href=#><i><span>People</span></i></a><span> in May 2014. “I’m like a cartoon character — my voice is little and I’m an excitable little person like them! I’m very childlike in that way, in my nature.”</span></p><p><span>In 2016, Dolly celebrated her 50th wedding anniversary along with the 50th anniversary of her start in show business. She reflected on <a href=#>her incredible success</a> during a November interview with </span><a href=#><i><span>Entertainment Tonight</span></i></a><span> that year.</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>“It makes you feel proud. It makes you feel old, but it makes you feel like you might have done something good in your life,” the </span><i><span>9 to 5</span></i><span> actress said at the time. “Just being a part of country music after all these years, I feel like I’ve been here a long time.”</span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The Songwriters Hall of Fame inductee has proven that she can do it all and does not plan on slowing down any time soon!<br></span><span><br></span><b>Keep scrolling to learn five facts you might not know about Dolly.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46dpqWkqWK9or7TqKVmnpGYwbR505qrraefqHqurdGroJqflWKxsLjLsq6op5RisabAwKKjrGWRo7Fuv8ScqZ6so2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-seaman-golf-balls-arsenal-30984025.html><span>←</span><span>David Seaman's golf balls have 'little semen' on and was called 'Harry Monk' by pals</span></a>
