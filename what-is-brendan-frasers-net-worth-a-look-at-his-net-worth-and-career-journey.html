A Look at His Net Worth and Career Journey</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Brendan Fraser made a name for himself in some of the best movies to ever grace the screens, but do these career milestones reflect in his net worth?</strong></p><p>Actor Brendan Fraser was once one of Hollywood’s leading men, with roles in “The Mummy,” and “George of the Jungle” establishing his claim to fame.</p><p>However, he receded to the sidelines as the years went by, under mysterious circumstances, even getting dubbed “The Movie Star that Hollywood Forgot” by Tribeca Film in 2014. After seemingly disappearing for years, Fraser made a big <a href=#>comeback</a> in 2022, starring in “The Whales,” stirring excitement among fans.</p><p>However, despite his big return to the screens, Branden Fraser does not hold a candle to his previous standing in Hollywood, or his net worth at the time. So how did the one-time heartthrob lose it all? How much is he worth today?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220930_102516.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Brendan_Frasers_Net_Worth></span><strong>What Is Brendan Fraser’s Net Worth?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Brendan Fraser has a <a href=#>net worth</a> of $20 million, which may seem like a fortune, but is only a fraction of what he once boasted of.</p><p>The icon, who made a career for himself as an actor, film producer, voice actor, and photographer, reached the peak of his stardom in the nineties, commanding up to $10 – $15 million for each movie role. His earnings ranked him among the highest-paid actors in the world.</p><p>At the peak of his stardom, Brenda Fraser had a net worth of $45 million, which all dissipated over the years, as he stumbled upon various tragedies.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Frasers_Career></span><strong>Fraser’s Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Brendan Fraser ventured into the movie industry in the early 90s, making his debut in 1991’s “Dogfight.” A year later, he snagged his first lead role in the comedy film, “Encino Man.”</p><p>The film’s success paved the way for other gigs, and before long, Fraser became a highly sought-after figure. Eventually, the actor landed his role in “George Of The Jungle,” which became his first major box office success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/George-of-the-Jungle.jpeg><p>Other notable movies starring Brendan Fraser include “Gods and Monsters,” “Dudley Do-Right,” “Monkeybone,” “The Mummy,” and its 2001 sequel “The Mummy Returns.”</p><p>He also landed various voice-acting gigs and made numerous guest appearances in TV shows like “Scrubs and “The Simpsons.”</p><p>After enjoying a smooth run in his <a href=#>career</a> for years with unmatched showbiz success, landing roles became a major concern for Fraser. Yet, he managed to secure some minor roles during the period, before making his sudden return in the late 10s.</p><p>Branden Fraser made appearances in a string of movies and TV shows, from “Line Of Descent,” to “Doom Patrol.” This led many publications to tag his return as “Brenaissance.”</p><p>His grand return was cemented when he was announced as the lead character in “The Whale.” The film premiered in September 2022 and received a six-minute standing ovation at the Venice International Film Festival.</p><p>With more upcoming movies like “Killers Of The Flower Moon,” “Batgirl,” and “Brothers,” Brendan Fraser has more opportunities to further boost his net worth, and perhaps, attain his former glory.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Brendan_Fraser_Lose_His_Previous_Net_Worth></span><strong>How Did Brendan Fraser Lose His Previous Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fraser did not descend to the bottom of his Hollywood career within a blink. Rather, it happened through the accumulation of various <a href=#>hurdles</a> in his personal life and career.</p><p>Most notably, Brendan Fraser’s 2009 divorce from his ex-wife and mother of his three children Afton Smith ate deeply into his net worth. This resulted from his standing court order to pay $50,000 monthly in alimony for ten years.</p><p>The amount would only cease if Smith remarried before the end of the stipulated period. In addition, the court mandated him to pay $25,000 per month in child support until January 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220930_102640.jpg><p>At the time of the agreement, Brendan still earned a substantial amount from his career. However, things began to take a downturn as the years progressed.</p><p>Ultimately, Fraser filed a petition for a reduction in the alimony and child support payments, due to his inability to meet up. The legal feud was so heated, that at some point, Smith accused her ex-husband of hoarding financial assets to sway the court in his favor.</p><p>He also dealt with pressing health concerns and became engulfed in several Hollywood scandals. Somehow, these interfered with his ability to land roles, forcing him to take the backseat for a while. Many even feared he had been blacklisted until he shocked the world with his return.</p><p>Notably, Brendan Fraser is not the only <a href=#>celebrity who lost their fortune</a> at the peak of their stardom. Stars like <a href=#>Toni Braxton</a> and Fantasia Barrino even filed for bankruptcy at some point in their lives.</p><p>Yet, they managed to pick themselves back up and continue to forge ahead in the world of entertainment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKmt02agrGWSp7KvsMCnZJ%2Bqkaiys7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJpkpaefoHqiwIyhoKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGjsW6vwKucnqpdn7y2vs2esGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amazon-opi-nail-envy-black-friday-sale-2022-6829322.html><span>←</span><span>OPIs Nail Envy Is On Sale for Black Friday 2022</span></a>
