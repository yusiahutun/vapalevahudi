Keep reading to find out.</span></p><h3><b>The Voice: Who Are Gina Miles Parents?</b></h3><p><span>Gina Miles loves her parents, Ryan Galey and Amy Buler to the moon. However, Amy isn’t her biological mother. Her father raised her all on his own. No wonder, she seems to like him more.</span></p><p><span>But this doesn’t mean Amy doesn’t love her. Infact, it was Gina’s stepmother who supported her when she wanted to pursue music more seriously and decided to move in with her aunt in Sacramento. The transition to a big city was very intimidating at first, but now, she’s a top 5 finalist on The Voice.</span></p><p><span>For the top-5 round, Gina chose Taylor Swift’s “Style,” which Niall called “ridiculous” and praised her for going with a pop song after all of the “haunting” songs she’s taken on before. She then closed out the evening with Sinead O’Connor’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“That was a special moment on ‘The Voice’ for me.” Niall shared. “She needs to win this thing.”</span></p><h3><b>Meet Ryan Galey, Gina Miles Father</b></h3><p><span>Ryan Galey is Gina Miles’ loving father.
