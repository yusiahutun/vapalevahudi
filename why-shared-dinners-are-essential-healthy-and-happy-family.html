There’s lots of information about what to cook for a family dinner but much less about that final, more ephemeral ingredient: how to make it happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/22/2a8c643c-c3ea-11e9-ad8c-27551fb90b05_1320x770_131152.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For us, storytelling, silliness, gratitude and a monumental (if sometimes failed) effort not to nag our kids to eat their food have powered a family dinner renaissance. And although every family is different, here are common themes that contribute to success.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As Jenny Rosenstrach, a cookbook writer and founding editor of the website Dinner: A Love Story explains, the dinner table needs to feel like a sanctuary – no nagging, no judgment, no phones. “At dinner, you should feel like you’re your best self, that you can be silly, that no friend is going to make fun of you,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/22/29625166-c3ea-11e9-ad8c-27551fb90b05_1320x770_131152.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To keep it that way, do not go over a to-do list, do not ask your partner if they picked up the dry cleaning and do not interrogate your kids about their homework. Most of all – and this is the really hard part – do not make what your kids are or are not eating a focal point. A child who is picking at food rightfully drives parents crazy. But nothing casts a chill over a conversation quite like faux-cheery urgings to eat “one more bite” and threats about withholding dessert.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Try not to cajole or bribe kids to eat their healthy food,” says Anne Fishel, a clinical psychologist and director of the Family Dinner Project, a growing movement that champions family dinner as an opportunity for family members to connect with each other through food, fun and conversation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It would be one thing if it worked, but it doesn’t. The research is pretty clear. When you say, ‘Eat your peas and then you can have your vanilla ice cream,’ you make the ice cream more desirable and the peas less so.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/22/2805bf88-c3ea-11e9-ad8c-27551fb90b05_1320x770_131152.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, model your own enjoyment of the food. Make children stakeholders in the meal as much as possible, by allowing them to choose items at the grocery shop, helping with cooking or clearing the table.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And if all else fails, remember that paediatricians say children’s nutrition matters on a weekly basis – one meal isn’t going to make or break it. A family meal is not the only place for storytelling, but it’s one of the most reliable ones.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I was a child, we had stories we told over and over. There was the time my father ran out of the house in the middle of the night without a stitch of clothing on because he thought a fox was after our puppies. Or the time a Canada goose chased my brother and me into a bush. These stories were part of the fabric of our family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some of the most powerful stories you can tell are about your own childhood.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">You can all go shopping together, come up with the idea together, cook together. You can live off the high of a good Sunday dinner for daysJenny Rosenstrach, a cookbook writer and founding editor of the website Dinner: A Love Story</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Parents who share stories about their childhood, particularly about overcoming things – the more kids hear those stories, the more they feel a part of something bigger and resiliency increases,” Rosenstrach says, referring to the groundbreaking research on family history and narratives from the Emory Centre for Myth and Ritual in American Life and documented in “The Secrets of Happy Families,” by Bruce Feiler. The prompt she still uses with her teenage daughters is, “Did I ever tell you the story?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fishel says that kids who know more family stories grow up with higher self esteem, and suffer less from depression and anxiety. “It also allows children to see that their parents weren’t always so competent, that they made mistakes and did silly things,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For instance, my kids love the story about a goose chasing me when I was a child, probably because my brother and I did something ridiculous when we shot toy arrows at a goose, then acted surprised when it chased us.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/22/29fc2f20-c3ea-11e9-ad8c-27551fb90b05_1320x770_131152.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Kids also enjoy stories about themselves. “Young kids are very egocentric,” Fishel says. “Their favourite stories are ones that feature themselves or events they experienced with their parents.” She suggests harnessing that self-focus by having grandparents or parents talk about stories from when they were the same age as the kids.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Even if it doesn’t come easily, there are ways to build in storytelling. My family and I play “the rose, the thorn and the bud”– talking about the best part of the day (the rose), the most challenging part (the thorn) and what we’re looking forward to tomorrow (the bud).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Routines tend to sound daunting, involving elaborate home cooking or a beautifully set table. But a sense of ritual comes from consistency and expectation, not magazine-worthy perfection. It can be as simple as Taco Tuesday or Sunday pancakes. For our family, the most consistent dinner ritual is a 4:30pm Friday meal at a pizza parlour.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rosenstrach suggests that if you cannot get your act together during the week when everyone’s busy, make Sunday dinner a special tradition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/22/5115d25a-c3ea-11e9-ad8c-27551fb90b05_1320x770_131152.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“You can all go shopping together, come up with the idea together, cook together,” she says. “You can live off the high of a good Sunday dinner for days.” It is historically a family dinner night, and when the clock is not ticking you can enjoy it. The more you enjoy family dinner, the more likely you are to do it again.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It’s also a time, especially if you have extended family members or friends over, when you can add games to make it a bit more special than a school-night meal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Fishel recommends Two Truths and a Tall Tale, where you tell two truths and a fib, and everyone has to guess the fib. Or have people write down answers to questions before dinner (such as: “What character in children’s literature do you most identify with?” “What was your favourite trip?”), put them in a hat, and then at the table pull out the answers and try to guess who wrote them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At least once a week, go around the table and have everyone say what they are grateful for.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/08/22/520eaf88-c3ea-11e9-ad8c-27551fb90b05_1320x770_131152.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Our kids’ responses are sometimes ridiculous (“I’m grateful for potty words”) and often heartfelt (“I’m grateful for time together”). In many religions and cultures, meals are where people express thankfulness for the food and for bringing family members and friends together. And like everything else with kids, a weekly or daily expression of gratitude builds a muscle: The more you do it, the more it will spill out into other parts of your children’s lives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lastly, tell jokes. The reason jokes are so effective is that silliness, openness, storytelling and fun are the ingredients that will keep your kids coming back to the table.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Washington Post</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLWmrcutn2avlaG5r7HSrGaaqqSesK2xjmxna2toan9ww8eyZKygkaeypXnDoqWnnaKoeqK%2BxGacrKuVo8Gqrctmn56ZnKm1unnAp5tmoJGlvbp5xZqkoqSp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-psychology-behind-realism.html><span>←</span><span>The Psychology behind Realism</span></a>
