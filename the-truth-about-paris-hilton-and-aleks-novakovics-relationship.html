"I think one of her biggest struggles is trust. She's been betrayed so many times so she has a real tough time trusting people and letting people in." After all, who could forget Hilton's&nbsp;<a href=#>allegedly leaked sex tape</a>&nbsp;with her then-boyfriend Rick Salomon? And we can see her sister's claims aren't exaggerated during the scene where Hilton installs spy cameras before her new boyfriend comes over to stay in her home.</p><p>But maybe Hilton's intuition wasn't entirely wrong. Later in the documentary, moments before she's set to go on stage to perform at one of her biggest DJ appearances yet, Tomorrowland, the two engage in a nasty lovers' quarrel. According to <a href=#>Forbes</a>, the altercation first pops off when Novakovic scolds Hilton for not giving him enough attention. As she walks toward the stage, Hilton begs him to stop the antics. "I love you, please, just stop, my gig starts in three minutes," she urges. When that doesn't work, she employs a more aggressive approach. "Are you psychotic?" she screams. "Oh my God, stop!" Hilton then demands that her security team remove his wrist bands before physically trying to remove them herself. In the next shot, viewers can see Novakovic being physically put into a van and whisked off the premises.
