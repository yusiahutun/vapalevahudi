You killed them – you, who were their mother.’<br></span></p><p><span>Donnison’s defence was always that she was mad, not bad. She went to great lengths to try to convince the police, her family, and the courts that she had lost her mind and had no memory of what she had done.</span></p><p><span>But at the heart of this case was a cold-blooded killer who, once she had lost control over the man she loved, was hell-bent on the ultimate revenge.<br></span></p><p><span>In an emotional address on the steps of the court, Mr Donnison, 48, called for the death penalty while criticising the criminal&nbsp; justice system, saying he had fewer rights than his children’s killer.<br></span></p><p><span>‘Taking a life is the most obscene act that anyone can commit, which in my view should receive an equal punishment,’ he said. ‘The pain and agony my family and I have suffered over the last year and a half over the murder of my beautiful children, Harry and Elise, has been almost unbearable.<br></span></p><p><span>‘The lives of these two beautiful, innocent and wonderful babies were taken from them in a most horrible and disgusting way. They did not stand a chance. The saddest thing today is that they will not grow older and enjoy their lives.’<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Donnison, who was questioned at length by defence counsel over his relationship with old schoolfriend Alison Shimmens, said he often felt that he was the one on trial, while Donnison was treated with ‘kid gloves’.<br></span></p><p><span>He said: ‘The horror of having to live with the murder of Harry and Elise was compounded by the clear ability of their murderer, despite admitting to the killings and being detained, to have more rights and considerations than I have.’<br></span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/09/article-2024179-0D5E254500000578-963_468x324.jpg height=324 width=468 alt="Trial: Donnison, a former city worker, spent most of the trial at Lewes Crown Court with her head bowed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Trial: Donnison, a former city worker, spent most of the trial at Lewes Crown Court with her head bowed</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/08/09/article-2024179-0D5E253400000578-756_468x306.jpg height=306 width=468 alt="Sentence: Donnison was jailed for a minimum of 32 years after a unanimous jury found her guilty on two counts of murder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sentence: Donnison was jailed for a minimum of 32 years after a unanimous jury found her guilty on two counts of murder</p><p><span>Paul Donnison was working as an insurance underwriter at a Lloyds syndicate in London when he met Fiona. Both were married at the time with two children each, but what started as a platonic friendship moved to something more.<br></span></p><p><span>Fiona Donnison, who left school at 18 and worked in Spain as a nanny for five years before landing her high-powered job as a credit manager, became pregnant in the first months of their relationship and gave birth to Mia in 2003.</span></p><p><span>The baby’s death less than a year later brought the couple closer together but by all accounts she pulled the strings in their relationship.<br></span></p><p><span>The couple never married, but Donnison changed her name by deed poll. By January last year, Mr Donnison had had enough of her jealousy and manipulative behaviour and broke off the relationship.</span></p><p><span>Lewes Crown Court was told that Donnison then used Harry and Elise as the ‘ultimate and final weapon’ to get back at him for starting a new relationship with Miss Shimmens.<br></span></p><p><span>After she smothered the&nbsp; toddlers at her rented house in Lightwater, Surrey, on January 26 last year, she put their bodies in two sports holdalls in the boot of their car. She then drove 90 miles to Heathfield, East Sussex, armed with two kitchen knives and stopped to buy sleeping pills on the way. She expected Mr Donnison to be at the marital home, but he was spending the night with Miss Shimmens.<br></span></p><p><span>Several hours later she walked into a police station saying she had murdered her children.<br></span></p><p><span>Mr Donnison’s brother, Mark, 46, said the family believed it was her original plan to either kill Paul and blame the children’s death on him, or frame him for the murders.<br></span></p><p><span>He added: ‘Paul will never get over this. He is absolutely devastated. Those children were his life and now he will never see them grow up.

They were very well-behaved children.</span></p><p><span>'We had a huge input with him.
