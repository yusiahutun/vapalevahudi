Less than two decades later, mountains with once-thick forests had been denuded by logging, as railways, factories and new homes were built.</p>The deforestation problem was serious, and amid the decade-long upheaval of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Cultural Revolution</span></a>, the Chinese government launched a tree-planting campaign in the late 1960s.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although it was driven by communist revolutionary spirit, the campaign was not entirely without planning or guidance. The pines were mainly planted in areas where the same species used to grow, and the saplings were guarded and looked after by local forestry authorities.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They looked like the other Mount Hua pines growing naturally nearby, but genetic sequencing showed that even in the same mountain range, the species could have different lineages, the botanists said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">They estimated that the first lineage branched off about 9 million years ago as a large mountain range formed across central China. Some tree species could not adapt to the dramatic change of environment and perished, but the Mount Hua pine survived and thrived.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Forest study in China finds mix of trees can absorb twice as much carbon as areas with one species</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its three lineages each have a distinct set of genes adapted to different environments, and there have been few genetic exchanges between them, according to the study.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the people planting the trees 50 years ago were not aware of the genetic differences, and planted the pines suited to lower altitude areas high up in the mountains, or the other way round.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few years later, many of them suddenly started to die, and the reforestation campaign was a disaster.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2020/06/24/web_pine.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:14</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">1,900-year-old pine discovered in southwest China</p><p>1,900-year-old pine discovered in southwest China</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Botanists have over the years offered several theories to explain why it happened, including acid rain and a disease-causing fungus, but they have all been proven wrong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There was no evidence of damage caused by environmental pollution, disease or climate change.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And none of the theories could explain why the same phenomenon had not happened again. Today, nearly all of the affected mountains have been reforested with Mount Hua pines, and the genetic analysis suggested their distribution follows a highly natural pattern. The scientists said there was very little sign of human influence on the distribution of the different pine lineages, which tended to dominate areas they were suited to.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Liu and the team put this down to “traditional wisdom”. Farmers and forestry authorities in the 1980s did not have access to genetic sequencing technology, but when they replanted the pines they used seeds from the trees that were growing naturally nearby. There has been no mass die-off since.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“They have followed the species-site matching principle [selecting a species suitable to the site] and kept human disturbance of the natural landscape to a minimum,” the researchers said in a statement.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Why are the floods so severe in China this year?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Xu Bo, a researcher with the Institute of Botany in Beijing who was not involved in the study, said the findings would help improve China’s tree-planting programme, which was the biggest in the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He also noted that “key traits of a plant cannot be seen from their appearance”. Xu said the traditional classification by species meant a plant’s adaptation to different environments could be overlooked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Genetic sequencing has been done on important crops such as rice, wheat and corn, but the genes of most plant species remain unknown.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are in an age of discovery,” Xu added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2BugnSBlWiZqKyRo7a0wNJmpJqxXZ2ut7GMsKaro5WZerDB02auobFdpbavsYytqZ6do2LAtrDDnqWlsV2Ztqaw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ahvianna-lee.html><span>←</span><span>Ahvianna Lee - Bio, Age, Height, Career, Net Worth, Facts</span></a>
