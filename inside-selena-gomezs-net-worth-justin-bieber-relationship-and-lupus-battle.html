The actress shot to fame as the world’s second most famous wizard and has since gone on to dominate the makeup and <a href=#>music</a> industry.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>A large following comes with unwanted attention on her private life so Celebrity Tidbit looks back into her dating history and career so far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-1249933668-1024x731.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Selena Gomez? Inside her family background and ethnicity</h2><p><strong>Full name</strong>: Selena Marie Gomez</p><p><strong>Hometown</strong>: Grand Prarie, Texas</p><p><strong>Relationship status</strong>: Single</p><p><strong>Birthday</strong>: July 22, 1992</p><p>The 30-year-old actress was born to Ricardo Joel Gomez and Mandy Teefey in 1992. She has proudly embraced her Mexican descent from her father’s side over the years through Spanish-speaking music releases. She is also of Italian ancestry from her mother.</p><p>Fans do not know much about Ricardo as Selena was raised by her mother after her parents’ divorce. The actress has consistently credited her mom for her showbiz success; Mandy was a stage actress who sacrificed her career to make ends meet for Selena.</p><p>Before exploding onto the Disney Channel scene, Selena scored her first role as Gianna on Barney & Friends. She appeared in 13 episodes from 2002 – 2004 until she was released for looking “too old” for the series.</p><p>Gomez reached teen idol status with her cameos on The Suite Life Of Zack & Cody and Hannah Montana and her leading role as sassy wizard Alex Russo.</p><p>The teen <a href=#>celebrity</a> star juggled acting with her music career, and despite criticism over her vocal talent, Selena’s music consistently reached the US Billboard Hot 10 and overseas charts.</p><p>In recent years, Selena has focused on her Hulu comedy series, Only Murders In The Building, and her sell-out makeup brand, Rare Beauty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-selena-s-net-worth-boosted-after-rare-beauty>Selena’s net worth boosted after Rare Beauty</h2><p>Selena has an impressive net worth of $95 million thanks to the success of her cosmetics company. In just four years, Rare Beauty has generated at least $60 million in revenue and has become one of the leading names in the saturated celebrity-owned brands.</p><p>Rare Beauty has resonated with fans due to its emphasis on self-confidence and inclusivity, a message that Selena has promoted since struggling with her own image and mental health.</p><p>Before launching her own brand, the actress was already securing big deals; she served as the face of Puma for two years as part of a $30 million deal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gomez isn’t afraid to discuss her mental health and lupus disease</h2><p>Despite being one of the most followed celebrities on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, Selena has kept her life relatively private and taken extended social media breaks to protect her mental health. The Come And Get It singer was diagnosed with lupus sometime between 2012 and 2014, an autoimmune disease that eventually impacted her <a href=#>health</a> and caused panic attacks and depression.</p><p>In October 2016, Gomez checked into rehab to manage her mental health. She vulnerably discussed her health complications and the pressures of fame in her intimate documentary film, My Mind & Me.</p><p>Selena received a kidney transplant from actress and friend Francia Raisa in 2017, but the status of their friendship has been questioned in recent years after Selena noted that <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> was “her only friend in the industry”. Gomez later clarified her remarks on Swift, saying: “Sorry I didn’t mention every person I know.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Selena Gomez’s dating history with Justin Bieber and Zayn Malik</h2><p><a href=#>Justin Bieber </a>managed to charm Selena in 2010 even after the actress admitted she only viewed him as a “little brother” on the Ellen Degeneres Show. The young <a href=#>Hollywood</a> It couple was the talk of the town as they united two massive teen fanbases, so you can imagine the heartbreak when they split.</p><p>They dated on and off until 2018. During their breaks, Selena was linked with Zedd and The Weeknd. The actress attended the Met Gala 2017 with The Weeknd, but they parted ways later that year.</p><p>She hasn’t dated anyone publically since, but that hasn’t stopped the relationship rumors. The Wolves singer was speculated to have dated <a href=#>Zayn Malik</a>, The Chainsmokers’ Drew Taggart, and even Chris Evans, but they are all untrue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-133859397-1024x696.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>And… She’s currently single</h2><p>In a&nbsp;<a href=#>TikTok</a>&nbsp;posted on June 8, 2023, the Calm Down hitmaker confirmed her relationship status while boldly flirting with a soccer team.</p><p>Selena looked cozy as she sat wrapped in a beige scarf and a fluffy blanket as she screamed: “I’m single! I’m just a little high maintenance…but I’ll love you so much!”</p><p>We love the honesty.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena Gomez’ online ‘feud’ with Hailey Bieber and Kylie Jenner took over TikTok</h2><p>Selena has never caught a break when it comes to her private life since her highly-publicized eight-year romance with Justin Bieber. Despite splitting for good over five years ago, the couple – known as Jelena by fans – are still dubbed as couple goals even though Justin is smitten with his wife <a href=#>Hailey Bieber</a>.</p><p>The narrative has blown so out of control that fans have cyberbullied Hailey since their marriage and even dragged Kylie Jenner into the complex dynamic.</p><p>Hailey clarified it was “all love” with Gomez during her September 2022 interview on Call Her Daddy and later put feud rumors to rest when they publically posed for photos at the 2022 Academy Museum Gala.</p><p>Fast forward to March 2023 when a TikTok user speculated at potential beef between Kylie and Selena. The latter posted a video to Instagram, laughing at her unexpectedly dramatic brow lamination. Hours later, Jenner posted a selfie with the text, “That was an accident?” placed over her eyebrows. Kylie then posted a close-up image of Hailey’s eyebrows, prompting fans to believe that the younger Jenner sister was making a dig at Selena.</p><p>Kylie denied she was shading Selena and called out the internet for “reaching”.</p><p>“No shade towards Selena ever and I didn’t see her eyebrow posts! U guys are making something out of nothing. This is silly,” she wrote.</p><p>Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber released statements on their social media simultaneously begging fans to end the hate.</p><p>“Hailey Bieber reached out to me and let me know that she has been receiving death threats and such hateful negativity,” Selena wrote. “This isn’t what I stand for. No one should have to experience hate to bullying.</p><p>The Rhode founder said: “I want to thank Selena for speaking out, as her and I have been discussing the last few weeks how to move past this ongoing narrative between her and I.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Selena’s Met Gala looks over the years</h2><p>Selena isn’t a regular <a href=#>Met Gala</a> guest, likely because she prefers to steer away from such hectic events. Nevertheless, she has served several jaw-dropping looks that we’ll never forget.</p><p><strong>2014 </strong>– Diane Von Furstenberg</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-488382015-646x1024.jpg><p><strong>2015 </strong>– Vera Wang</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-472216588-688x1024.jpg><p><strong>2016 </strong>– Louis Vuitton</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-527343716-679x1024.jpg><p><strong>2017 </strong>– Coach</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-675629644-681x1024.jpg><p><strong>2018 </strong>– Coach</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/06/GettyImages-955802298-1024x684.jpg><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlvX2WAcLXNrKCdnV2osq2xzZpkoKedmse0ec2eq2avn6fBqXnJrqqtoZ5ir6qxwZ6pZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGKur7CMpaypraNir6LA06WcaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hodophile-a-person-who-loves-to-travel.html><span>←</span><span>Hodophile: A Person who Loves to Travel</span></a>
