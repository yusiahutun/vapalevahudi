Can someone wake me up from this nightmare please? I just want my life back.&nbsp;
I want health. I want energy.
I want this port out of my chest.
I want my hair, lashes, and brows.
I want to have two breasts.
I want the ability to go out with friends and have a drink or two.
I want to know happiness and stop feeling so blue."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
