The timing is always tight with these things, and obviously we were working with Japanese hours, but they were honestly the nicest team to work with. I've never known anyone work as hard as the Uniqlo team – they were such a joy to collaborate with.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The end result is a collection that is made up of jumpers, both cashmere and lambs’ wool, scarves, hats, gloves and socks, for both women and children. The designer has taken Uniqlo pieces and given them a little Anya spin with exposed seams, embroidered details, and of course those trademark googly eyes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They asked what I wanted to design – we actually did knitwear years ago, and people always ask us to bring it back but because we have such a wide range of products, we wanted to wait for the right opportunity, and this really felt like it,” she says. “As I've said, I am such a huge fan of their knitwear so I really wanted to play around with that.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think their shapes are absolutely perfect – they have totally nailed that, and the fabrics are amazing,” she adds. “The cashmere actually gets better as it's washed more. So, we decided to keep the shapes the same and then deconstruct them – not reconfigure them, but just expose the seams or add a little detail, almost like graffiti on the arm. We wanted to keep them the same but basically mess them up a little bit.”</p><img alt="anya hindmarch x uniqlo" title="anya hindmarch x uniqlo" width=4200 height=6300 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anya-hindmarch-uniqlo-3-65560fa9dcd78.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Uniqlo x Anya Hindmarch</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It was a really simple approach – we wanted to keep what they are brilliant at and then add a bit of us to that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The collection is a perfect example of elevated basics, and nods to the growing movement that Hindmarch has seen with her own customer, and with herself personally, in choosing to only buy versatile and timeless pieces that will be in your wardrobe for a very long time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I love that Uniqlo calls their clothes Lifewear because I think that attitude is really important. I am all about responsible shopping and buying pieces that are made to last and will be worn for a lifetime.”</p><img alt="anya hindmarch x uniqlo" title="anya hindmarch x uniqlo" width=6000 height=4500 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anya-hindmarch-uniqlo-4-65560fa9eed6f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Uniqlo x Anya Hindmarch</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">These are considered purchases that are easy to style, but, at the same time, Hindmarch knows that what people are looking for with fashion – especially her's – is that hit of dopamine, and that’s exactly what she wants to give them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“For me, the whole point of fashion is to change your mood because nobody needs another piece of clothing to cover their body – we've all got everything we need for the rest of our lives. The point of fashion is to make you feel happy or to make you feel confident, that's what interests me about fashion – it is the mood and confidence-altering aspects. And that’s exactly what I wanted to do with this collection, I wanted to bring a little joy.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/contents/collaboration/uniqloxanyahindmarch/23fw/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Anya Hindmarch x Uniqlo collection is available to shop online and in stores now." data-vars-ga-product-id=43f94fb9-9c1a-4b07-8c59-66dc2ea89106 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/contents/collaboration/uniqloxanyahindmarch/23fw/ data-product-url=https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/contents/collaboration/uniqloxanyahindmarch/23fw/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uniqlo.com%2Fuk%2Fen%2Fcontents%2Fcollaboration%2Funiqloxanyahindmarch%2F23fw%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=ba215e93-ff27-4dd4-9fbc-56cd05bf4c34 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">The Anya Hindmarch x Uniqlo collection is available to shop online and in stores now.</a></p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Brooke Shields: Inside my beauty bag" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-imbb-bs-3-copy-653a4799b5520.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwssCsn6KnnmSzor%2FHoqanZZ6axLR7wG1scW1paYJ4e8CnsJplmJ67pbnAq5qhZaWjtrK4zmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./singles-inferno-couples-still-together.html><span>←</span><span>Where Couples are Now 2024</span></a>
