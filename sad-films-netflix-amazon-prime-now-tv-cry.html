Starring Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, the story follows a couple who adopt a chaotic yet loveable dog, Marley, who is by their side through the highs and lows of their lives. <strong>Maybe just switch it off halfway through if you're keen to avoid sobbing for hours.&nbsp;</strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8465c4cbdc25-marleyandme-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><h2>The Impossible</h2><p id=eX4EMRpBZ-TP data-wc=61>A family holidaying in Thailand are hit by the horrific 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Torn apart due to the natural disaster with no way of knowing if their loved ones are alive, the family fight for survival while desperately trying to find out information. Based on true events, this is a heartbreaking look at the horrific incident which killed 227,898 people.</p><p id=ek1vu8SyavxT data-wc=4><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Netflix</p><p id=esCAUAhYaww5 data-wc=7><strong>WATCH: Will you be watching The Impossible?</strong></p><h2>All The Bright Places</h2><p id=e_ODl770izpB data-wc=80>All The Bright Places tells the story of Violet Markey and Theodore Finch, who meet and change each other’s lives forever. The synopsis reads: "As they struggle with the emotional and physical scars of their past, they come together, discovering that even the smallest places and moments can mean something. This compelling drama provides a refreshing and human take on the experience of mental illness, its impact on relationships, as well as the beauty and lasting impact of young love."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3b2370b6aef0-all-bright-places-z.jpg><h2>PS I Love You</h2><p id=eijo-LkmH56A data-wc=78>A widow deals with the grief of losing her husband with his help – as she receives a letter every month from him for a year after his death. The letters tell her new things to try and places to visit – sending her on a funny, emotional adventure, and eventually helping her to get through the roughest few months of her life as we see flashbacks of their lives together. Naturally, tears are more or less guaranteed.</p><p id=eyT2brNBk8Hg data-wc=4><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Netflix</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e8b72b259cef-ps-love-you-z.jpg><h2>The Fault in Our Stars</h2><p id=ehEZEmaAgVl5 data-wc=45>Hazel Grace is a terminally ill cancer sufferer who falls in love with Augustus, a cancer survivor who lost his leg from the illness. The pair have an amazing connection as they fall for one another and enjoy a shared love of books and films.</p><p id=eBnp_BypDsbL data-wc=56>Of course, The Fault in our Stars is famously heartbreaking, and while we won't spoil it for you, of course things take an awful turn. It is a brilliant film with perfect performances from Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, and chances are you won't be able to stop thinking about it long after the final scene.</p><p id=ed60M8G-7tDS data-wc=6><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Amazon Prime Video</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ea9d55ddcb15-film-fault-stars-z.jpg><h2>About Time</h2><p id=eQ8ZmPRNxC_Z data-wc=77>Sometimes it is the light-hearted rom-coms that can make us cry the most – and this is one of those times! The film follows the life of Tim, a VERY Richard Curtis-esque protagonist who finds out that he can travel in time, and uses this little trick to get the woman of his dreams. You fall a little bit in love with all of the characters, and so when tragedy strikes – it certainly packs a punch.</p><p id=ebvYYSD0wph6 data-wc=6><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Amazon Prime Video</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/478ac022db59-film-about-time-z.jpg><h2>Irreplaceable You</h2><p id=eZNpFxDFpXAc data-wc=57>Abbie and Sam were childhood best friends and are engaged when their worlds are torn apart when Abbie is diagnosed with terminal cancer. In order to help the love of her life move on from her, Abbie becomes determined to find a new person to fall in love with Sam, while trying to accept her own situation.</p><p id=esB-briiTSgc data-wc=4><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Netflix</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e2cae67117a2-film-irreplaceable-z.jpg><h2>The Miracle Season</h2><p id=e0Sh-F8JxKYt data-wc=77>Based on a true story, The Miracle Season follows the devastating fall out of Caroline 'Line' Found's death, a vivacious and beloved volleyball captain at her High School volleyball team who was tragically killed in a moped accident. The heartbroken team decide to continue playing in her honour, and bring the devastated community together to remember her. Warning, you won't cry just the once at this one. It's a 'blubbing through the whole film' sort of situation.</p><p id=ecgdOnf3Jckh data-wc=6><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Amazon Prime Video</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1af1b94c257b-film-miracle-season-z.jpg><h2>Wonder</h2><p id=eRlgggOBwjGB data-wc=90>Auggie is a bright, happy 10-year-old who has been home schooled all of his life due to his condition - mandibulofacial dysostosis – which has forced him to undergo 27 different surgeries on his face. Wonder follows young Auggie as he starts school for the first time, and his trials and tribulations with making friends and dealing with bullies. Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson play his worried but loving parents, and it is such a sweet, feel good story that you'll be crying tears of joy at the end, guaranteed.</p><p id=e5TFjCuCh2Nc data-wc=4><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4b64cceed9a2-film-wonder-z.jpg><h2>Good Will Hunting</h2><p id=eGWEWvdRhKEB data-wc=93>Will is a genius delinquent who uses his extensive knowledge of the law to get him out of sticky situations. During community service at MIT, he solves a mathematical puzzle that none of the students could get, attracting the attention of Professor Gerald Lambeau. The professor enlists the help of his own college friend Dr Sean Maguire to take on Will's court appointed therapy sessions, and the pair slowly begin to form a deep bond. A powerhouse performance from Robin Williams, and an amazing story you'll want to watch over and over again.</p><p id=e0Nat36dHBQ- data-wc=6><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Amazon Prime Video</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b83b4f1b9c7c-film-good-z.jpg><h2>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</h2><p id=ertCXPrzEzXc data-wc=83>A devastating story about the Holocaust told from the point of view of Bruno, the son of a Nazi officer who relocates his family to reside near to a concentration camp for work. With no idea of the truth about the camp, Bruno befriends a young Jewish boy, Shmuel, who he believes is simply wearing pyjamas. The pair often met up and talk through the fences, and Bruno smuggles him food. The ending is unbearably awful – but it is a necessary one.</p><p id=efjzn-OKHPSJ data-wc=4><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Netflix</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/34374475b2ce-film-boy-z.jpg><h2>My Girl</h2><p id=ep69Z6mjduES data-wc=51>A young hypochondriac girl lives with her emotionally unavailable father after the death of her mother, and is best friends with her next door neighbour, Thomas. What begins as a sweet coming-of-age tale turns to tragedy when [spoiler alert!], Thomas is killed from an allergic reaction to bees, leaving her devastated.</p><p id=e34u6rEOiB29 data-wc=6><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Amazon Prime Video</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19d124563380-film-my-girl-z.jpg><h2>Lion</h2><p id=ePYXkZDuXkJS data-wc=89>Based on a true story, Lion follows the story of Saroo, an Indian-born Australian who was adopted from his home country after accidentally falling asleep on a train and being transported to the other side of the country – getting so lost that he couldn't find his way home again. As an adult, Saroo becomes determined to track down his home and his family with only the information he knew as a very young boy. The last couple of minutes will make you burst into tears, you've been warned.</p><p id=emqYFPVh9bhY data-wc=6><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Amazon Prime Video</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b063fb7944d6-film-lion-z.jpg><h2>Finding Nemo</h2><p id=eywx-D_OOXSe data-wc=65>Thanks to NOW TV's impressive selection of Pixar films, get ready for the most tear jerking selection available, starting with Finding Nemo! The opening few minutes of the film sees happily married fish Coral and Carl discussing the arrival of their hundreds of children… when another fish comes along and kills them all – and Coral – leaving Carl with just one egg: little Nemo.</p><p id=enmovEQL7jjf data-wc=4><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Disney+</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/66b4b0023817-film-marlin-z.jpg><h2>Coco</h2><p id=eYJf9Ux8Ul55 data-wc=73>Young Miguel is desperate to become a musician, but his family won't hear of it after their ancestor left his great-great-grandmother to become a famous musician. In the Day of the Dead, Miguel steals a guitar and accidentally lands himself in the Land of the Dead. The story is all about family, and remembering loved ones after you've lost them, and will make you laugh, cry, and give your loved ones a call.</p><p id=eiyNOl0eYxOp data-wc=4><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Disney+</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d4f07e949f67-film-coco-z.jpg><h2>Big Hero 6</h2><p id=ek2Hm63pixpK data-wc=78>Young Hiro is a teenage genius who hugely looks up to his big brother, researcher Tadashi, and has an amazing time in his research life inventing incredible new technology - microbots.

STILL NO ARRESTS? HOW COME, CHIEF WILLOUGHBY?" While the billboards gain national attention, they cause problems within the town – particularly within the police department, who are furious at Mildred, particularly since Willoughby is suffering from terminal cancer. This is a brilliant film and it will certainly bring the tears.</p><p id=eGTbtWKocuae data-wc=6><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Amazon Prime Video</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1e5786bfb2fe-film-three-billboards-z.jpg><h2>Lion King</h2><p id=ehi6y4RkALb2 data-wc=73>Being heartbroken over the death of Mufasa is a rite of passage we all had to go through as children, and fortunately the film is still on NOW TV and can continue to devastate us all!

While it initially seems like the pair could be living in poverty, it soon transpires that 'Ma' is actually a kidnap victim, and Jack is a result of her captivity, and that they are trapped in the room with no way of escaping. Brie Larson's role as Ma won an Oscar, and for good reason.</p><p id=ec-UnzHSb17A data-wc=6><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Amazon Prime Video</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f4139d5bbb63-film-room-z.jpg><h2>Manchester by the Sea</h2><p id=eNnolsOTXMUA data-wc=77>After his brother dies, Lee Chandler is forced to return to his home to take care for his nephew.

However, the romance takes a drastic turn when Henry travels ahead of his own life span, and finds out exactly when and how he dies – leaving both of them devastated.</p><p id=eA0NrIORFEdiC data-wc=4><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Netflix</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0813571a395f-film-time-z.jpg><h2>The Green Mile</h2><p id=ewXv-ICgAmpFi data-wc=70>This Stephen King adaptation follows Paul Edgecomb, an elderly man living in an care home who decides to tell the story of the most meaningful experience of his life to his friend, Elaine.

In fact, she was a designer baby made so that she could be a genetic match for Kate and help with her treatments. However, when Kate needs a kidney transplant, teenage Anna decides to sue her parents for the rights to her own body. It's slightly ridiculous in parts (hi Alec Baldwin), but overall it's devastating, and chances are you probably wouldn't want to watch it more than once.</p><p id=e5-iMVmrPhYUZ data-wc=9><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Available to rent/buy on Amazon Prime</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/22eadaa721d0-film-sisters-z.jpg><h2>Me Before You</h2><p id=eZkxYJEGxBQtT data-wc=76>Lou is financially struggling, and out of desperation, agrees to a job as a carer for a quadriplegic man who had a highly active life before he was hurt in a motorbike accident.
