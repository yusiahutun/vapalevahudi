As a certified summer enthusiast, the only things that really thrill me about winter weather are one, mulled wine and two, the endless layering options of winter fashion. And an essential piece to layering effectively is the sweater.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because sweaters are a relatively broad category, we searched far and wide for the best options based on material, cut, and design. We've found stylish <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>cardigans</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>toasty wool options</a>, and ultra-soft <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>cashmere</a> pieces as well. We even tapped three fashion stylists for advice on how to style our favorite pieces. Michaela Leitz, a fashion stylist based in Frankfurt, ultimately recommends cashmere sweaters, calling them the go-to option in the winter. "Cashmere feels very soft, cozy, and breathable, and the fact that they are often thinner makes them perfect for packing during winter trips." Still, we included plenty of other options on this list so you can stock up your winter closet.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-uniqlo-cashmere-crew-neck-long-sleeve-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Uniqlo Cashmere Crew Neck Long Sleeve Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UNIQLO Cashmere Crew Neck Long Sleeve Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BuywoOPxjlXXglkfQ2qETdbzFr4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/UNIQLO-Cashmere-Crew-Neck-Long-Sleeve-Sweater-a710429cf32345708ba99c8f8a96c525.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>UNIQLO</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>For the material, cut, and style, the price is a true steal.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>You have to get it dry cleaned or wash it by hand.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Typically, finding a cashmere sweater under the $100 mark is quite rare, but this one from Uniqlo meets us right at the mark. Not only is it impossibly soft, but the crewneck style is universally loved, easy to style, and always elegant. Our very own senior editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hayley Prokos </a>considers it her "holy grail winter item," purchasing a black one two years ago and another in navy a year after. She loved it so much, that she proceeded to get a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">men's version</a> for her husband. If that doesn't vouch for her love of the lightweight knit, we don't know what would. With all things cashmere, however, be extra careful with how you wash it. Uniqlo recommends hand washing cold or dry cleaning, and avoiding any hangers as it might stretch the item out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Cashmere | <strong>Colors: </strong>15 | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-yousify-ribbed-chunky-knit-pullover></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Yousify Ribbed Chunky Knit Pullover</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Yousify Ribbed Chunky Knit Pullover " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PA0pNzMzCjVI8c5WwchQxpiBqU0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/yousify-ribbed-chunky-knit-pullover-e14ec985e03647b096382e2a3e5e9f5d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The lightweight material makes layering a breeze.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It’s slightly more oversized than the picture makes it seem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone looking for an inexpensive pick, this lightweight sweater will make it easy to layer, yet on its own can still keep you warm. The reviewers who purchased the item say they received a well-constructed knit, regardless of which subdued color they chose. Although a few did state that it is slightly more oversized than pictured —&nbsp;not enough to size down completely — just know that it will sit more loosely around you than advertised.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Acrylic, nylon, polyester |<strong> Colors: </strong>7 |<strong> Size: </strong>S-XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-attire-the-studio-courchevel-sweater-taupe></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Attire The Studio Courchevel Sweater Taupe</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Attire The Studio Courchevel Sweater Taupe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j4DF0LjsWBkHyri4YNnBREQBxpI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/attire-the-studio-courchevel-sweater-taupe-a2008b5b01bb453da45d83b6d66cc43d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Attire The Studio&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It's made of 100 percent responsibly sourced wool.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Wool may or may not feel slightly scratchy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Splurging on a piece means the material needs to be top-notch, the style needs to be everlasting, and an ease to wear it with anything and everything should be prominent. Not only does this 100 percent wool sweater check all of these boxes, but it comes with additional perks too, like the fact that it's sustainably made with responsibly sourced wool from Australia and South Africa, meeting the Responsible Wool Standard (RWS) certification. The sweater is also undeniably chic, with a cable knit design down the front, a mock neck, and extra long and wide sleeves. Add on the fact that it's heavy-knit, and you're guaranteed unmatched warmth as well. Wool can occasionally cause a little scratchy sensation, however, so perhaps wear a little base layer underneath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 |<strong> Size: </strong>XS-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-chunky-jcrew-cable-knit-stretch-cardigan-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Chunky</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Cable-knit Stretch Cardigan Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew Cable-knit Stretch Cardigan Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/__rbRMP9XuW6jL6Fk0v0m8AEiiU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/J.Crew-Cable-knit-Stretch-Cardigan-Sweater-bc9443e71cc74e0a980e4317af89fd6e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.Crew</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The various wools in the sweater will keep you extra warm.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>On top of being oversized, it runs a little large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One can never go wrong with a classic cable-knit sweater. The style is usually thick and warm and always looks chic during the cooler months. This one in particular is mostly made of acrylic, merino wool, and alpaca, ensuring it’s going to be sufficiently cozy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The J.Crew Cardigan Sweater features an oversized cut, with a generous body and a hem reaching all the way down to your upper thigh. It might not hurt to size down, especially since customers say it runs a little large. It does, however, make it the ideal layering piece over shirts and under coats. And while we always appreciate a classic cream or a brown, it’s offered in a Barbiecore pink and blue as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Acrylic, merino wool, polyamide, alpaca, elastane |<strong> Colors: </strong>4<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>XXXS–3XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-good-american-ribbed-mock-neck-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Good American Ribbed Mock Neck Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Good American Ribbed Mock Neck Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/iMgAjtCnQjOEvjlGYhFPqKBsowM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Good-American-Ribbed-Mock-Neck-Sweater-4f7e44f4409e4955a89516690fe294df.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Good American</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Your neck will stay amply warm thanks to the mock neck.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s only offered in one color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it’s cold out, there’s nothing more ideal than snuggling your entire body in the embrace of a mock-neck sweater. While Good American might be best known for jeans, its line of sweaters deserves equal amounts of praise. This one in particular comes in a ribbed pattern, with a subtle blouson sleeve and a hem that stops just where your jeans start. As something that’s neither fitted nor oversized, it’s easier to style and wear more frequently. We always appreciate the brand offering us images of two different models with various figures, allowing us to envision how it may look on our actual bodies. We only wish it was offered in more colors outside of just black.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Viscose, polyester, nylon |<strong> Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–5XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-turtleneck-abercrombie--fitch-tuckable-easy-turtleneck-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Turtleneck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch Tuckable Easy Turtleneck Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch Tuckable Easy Turtleneck Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/shJDTxW9fDyoXwYT5hDtnfxfiQo=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abercrombie--Fitch-Tuckable-Easy-Turtleneck-Sweater-64212d514dd64e6388ba56bb7c2abb0e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It comes in a bunch of earthy colors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s a little oversized, but sizing down would cause the sleeves to shorten.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want a little more coverage than a mock neck, then a cozy turtleneck is the way to go. Simple yet elegant, this option from Abercrombie is like the blueprint for the best turtleneck sweater. It’s got the ribbed neck and cuffs, a hem that’s not too short or too long, and a cozy non-itch fabric. Customers say it’s slightly oversized, but sizing down would shorten the sleeves. We recommend sticking to your true size but expect it to feel extra relaxed in the loose embrace. It’s offered in a variety of earthy tones, from brown to forest green, and one striped option. Honestly, considering the relatively affordable price, you could just get one of each and call it a day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Polyester, nylon, acrylic, wool, elastane&nbsp; |<strong> Colors: </strong>7<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>XXS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-off-the-shoulder-brochu-walker-the-lori-off-shoulder-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Off-the-Shoulder</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Brochu Walker Off Shoulder Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Brochu Walker The Lori Off Shoulder Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/7fX3-oA_eAK0SerQhtD3n8gHd_w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Brochu-Walker-The-Lori-Off-Shoulder-9436d9c62dc3407fb3d990ffe47e3fae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Brochu Walker</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s incredibly soft.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We wish the size range was more inclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s something about an off-the-shoulder sweater that’s so effortless yet sultry. Commerce editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Cieslak</a> kindly received this sweater from the brand, and immediately fell in love with the cozy cashmere that feels like a hug. Due to the finely knit yarn, the fabric is extremely lightweight and soft, making it an ideal jumper for those who live in warmer climates like Los Angeles, where donning a chunky turtleneck feels a tad impractical. As a petite person, she appreciated the ribbed cuffs at the sleeves and hem, since this allowed her to push up the sleeves and place the hem above her bottoms for the most figure-flattering look. No drowning in fabric here! In fact, this sweater strikes the perfect balance of fitted and oversized, nailing the swaddled look. Not to mention the neckline can be customized, whether that’s a boatneck, one shoulder, or baring both.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We admit this sweater is pricey, but if you consider the timeless silhouette and high-quality fabric, it can be a worthy investment. It’s made from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Responsible Wool Standard-certified</a>, traceable yarn, meaning it adheres to stringent animal welfare standards. But for the high price, we would hope to see a more inclusive size range.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Cashmere |<strong> Colors: </strong>11<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>XS–L</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sweater-vest-anthropologie-oversized-cable-knit-sweater-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Sweater Vest</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anthropologie Oversized Cable-Knit Sweater Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Oversized Cable-Knit Sweater Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MQ1J0OPFvp_cPOycjcYixgfTiRQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Anthropologie-Oversized-Cable-Knit-Sweater-17837c4632d7428c919cf03b0b0cbe11.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The styling options are endless here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You will have to hand wash this sweater.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What was once a staple in every Dad’s closet is now a stylish touch to a woman’s outfit. Yes, we’re talking about the sweater vest, and this option from Anthropologie has perfected the look. Featuring a cable-knit pattern on the front, the loose vest is equal parts laid-back and buttoned up. Depending on how you style it, it can go from a casual addition to your athleisure ensemble or a preppy addition to your skirt and loafers. Needless to say, there’s a lot that can be done with a sweater vest, so opting for this neutral gray color is the way to go. Again, you will have to hand wash this piece, but we think the cute look is well worth the effort.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Acrylic, polyester, polyamide | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cable-knit-aelfric-eden-cable-knit-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cable Knit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aelfric Eden Cable-knit Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Aelfric Eden Cable-knit Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pk87-jV4zIOTvBCwP72AcW6R8Ok=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Aelfric-Eden-Cable-knit-Sweater-0315cd9786ce45508cbcfcd12c2f459c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Reviewers confirm it’s thick and soft.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You have to hand wash this piece.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We don’t know about you, but when it comes to cable knit sweaters, we look for that vintage, borrowed-from-your-father look. This piece from Aelfric delivers just that. And the best part? It comes in 35 different colors, some of which have different stitch patterns in the front, allowing you to stock up on this affordable option. The reviews all confirm that the 100 percent cotton piece is nice and soft, looking as good in real life as pictured on the model. They also all echo each other saying that the sweater is nice and thick — in other words, it won’t have any trouble keeping you warm. Just make sure not to throw it in the washer, as this is a hand-wash only piece.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Cotton, organic cotton |<strong> Colors: </strong>35<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XXL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cardigan-zara-striped-basic-cardigan></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cardigan</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zara Striped Basic Cardigan</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1018 data-sizes=750px alt="Zara Striped Basic Cardigan" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nezY2onY2B1lPPyZwS2Fqxp8Cno=/fit-in/1500x1018/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ZaraStripedBasicCardigan-eb9c1294d2c345f98b956c5970d97e43.png"><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pearl button closure adds a touch of poshness to the look.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You cannot tumble dry this item.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Is it just me, or is the sailor aesthetic beginning to trend again? I'm seeing stripes everywhere, and this Zara cardigan is a great example of just that. Available in two versions of navy and cream, just inverted, the item adds a subtle touch of visual texture to your typically monochromatic look. We especially adore the pearl button closure down the front, which almost serves as a touch of poshness. In order for them to stay in place, however, Zara recommends avoiding tumble-drying.

It comes in an extra oversized fit, which is ideal for layering. Dropped shoulders and extra long sleeves make it appear relaxed and effortless — even if keeping the cream color clean is anything but.

I recently got to try this knit from Henne, and instantly crowned it my new favorite sweater. It’s made of a blend of alpaca wool and sheep’s wool, along with some nylon and polyester which help to offset the itchiness that wool is notoriously known for. Thanks to the latter two components, I found the sweater only mildly scratchy if I wore nothing underneath it. As someone who despises anything itchy, I can say it was so mild, it did not actually bother me. The luxurious material and sophisticated design far outweigh any cons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Materials: </strong>Alpaca wool, wool, polyester, nylon, elastane | <strong>Colors: </strong>5<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-v-neck-sandro-paris-contrast-v-neck-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best V-Neck</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sandro Paris Contrast V-neck Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sandro Paris Contrast V-neck Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j0jUd2wys-LrwV2rcMB2ELAiCmI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sandro-Paris-Contrast-V-neck-Sweater-8a4727ec942d4ae4bc8138d1a2fd9bc5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sandro</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s made of wool and cashmere, ensuring warmth and comfort.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It’s only offered in one color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Sandro sweater sits at the intersection of warm and soft, thanks to its cashmere-wool blend makeup. It’s less thick and bulky than some of the other options on this list, but the insulation properties of the two materials make up for it sufficiently. It has an endearing outlined V-neck, reminiscent of a school girl uniform but elevated. While it’s difficult to see on the black sweater, it’s actually sporting a cable-knit on the main body. The chic piece can be worn on its own or over a dress shirt for a more spiffy attire.

With its green logo embroidered on the left chest, this turtleneck cropped sweater looks rather simple and elegant — a preppy staple — yet features small details to make it a touch more special. The hem, cuffs, and neck portion have a ribbed knit to them, which helps round out the overall look, and instead of being composed of just wool, the brand incorporated 30 percent cashmere, too, for additional softness. Unfortunately, they happen to be two of the most difficult fabrics to clean, and considering this comes in ivory, you’re going to want to be extra careful not to get it dirty.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Wool, cashmere<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Size: </strong>XS-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cashmere-everlane-cashmere-crew></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cashmere</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane Cashmere Crew</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Cashmere Crew" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2Fj9nogdTbMS5Kag9k2z19H23yk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-cashmere-crew-a2dcd63d954940298f9ac6913ba8f15a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s made of 100 percent Grade A cashmere, which lasts longer and pills less.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It has to be hand washed or dry cleaned.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Everlane’s super-soft sweater, which we already named our best overall cashmere sweater,&nbsp;comes in a classic fitted crewneck that will serve as an everyday piece for years to come. Like linen, cashmere gets only softer with time, especially when it's 100 percent Grade A cashmere, which pills less and makes for a worthwhile investment that will last forever. “A crewneck sweater looks the chicest in cashmere while tucked in a pair of vintage denim with an oversized bomber jacket or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blazer</a> over it,” says stylist Britt Theodora.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Grade A cashmere | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Size: </strong>XXS-3XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-szane-noan-marinire></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sézane Noan Marinière</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="S&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;zane Noan Marini&amp;Atilde;&amp;uml;re" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nn8eGxsCCOtwx8enYTDn-S9Xr3M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/szane-noan-marinire-2b08a25c305c4f20a82e46fea02d37c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SÃ©zane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> There are four buttons on either side of the sweater for an adjustable slit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>You will have to size down for a more form-fitting look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of giving us nautical inspiration, Parisian label Sézane brought more French inspiration forth with this organic cotton striped sweater. This sweater features two large slits on either side, which can be adjusted via four endearing buttons, while the boat neckline and loose fit only add to that certain je nais se quois appeal the French have perfected over the years. The brand does recommend sizing down if you wish for a more form-fitting look, however, because the sweater runs a little oversized on its own. That being said, the sleeves are rather slim and cut short around your wrists.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Organic<strong> </strong>cotton | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Size: </strong>XXS-3XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-striped-la-ligne-marine-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Striped</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>La Ligne Marine Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Ligne Marine Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8fbUz8wAbLnZh8wm_Zbapvuk29I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/la-ligne-marine-sweater-5262c5453c7e43b9bc4fe48e70066300.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>La Ligne</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There are endless color and stripe combinations.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It’s hand-wash or dry-clean only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What better place to buy stripes than a company literally named the Line? This sweater was created and designed by former Vogue editors, who see beauty in the universal appeal of a stripe. The Marin sweater proves that stripes in all color combinations (seriously, there are 16 different versions in just this option) deserve a spot in your closet because it never fails to look good. Each colorway varies in design a bit, too, giving you an excuse to own more than one. For example, instead of just basic stripes on the body as some of the colorways have, the tan/multi option has three accent-colored stripes on the sleeve that contrast the rest of the neutral sweater.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made of 30 percent cashmere and 70 percent wool, the high-quality sweater will be durable and warm — there’s a reason why La Ligne is beloved by InStyle editors.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Organic Cotton | <strong>Colors: </strong>15 |<strong> Size: </strong>XS-XL</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-printed-kenzo-boke-flower-cardigan></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Printed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kenzo Boke Flower Cardigan</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kenzo Boke Flower Cardigan " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nqvvFnyblX5GCXQXwAx3B7Wksmw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kenzo-boke-flower-cardigan-36512387e65543c4a6e91c0114e43406.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Farfetch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The endearing print manages to look mature despite the large florals covering the front and back.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>You can only hand-wash this piece.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re ready to switch up the classics and go for a little print, I highly recommend this endearing floral cardigan from Kenzo. Coming in navy blue, it manages to look mature and polished despite the large flower prints covering the front and back. The cardigan, which is constructed from a wool and cotton blend, comes with a V-neck cut and four buttons down the front. “Cardigans are a staple for me in the winter, as I’ll wear them as a top with high-waisted jeans and lots of fun necklaces," says Theodora.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unfortunately, there are no pockets to be found anywhere on this piece, and you can also only hand-wash this piece, according to the label.

Without being too exaggerated, the turtleneck will provide enough warmth yet still hug your neck in a more sophisticated way.

In order to dive into the first point, let’s talk about the material. To keep it affordable, we found many pieces that contain polyester, acrylic, and nylon, which, yes, have a bad reputation. But when mixed with natural fibers, like wool, cashmere, and cotton, you’ll receive the same benefits, only at a lower price. Natural fibers tend to be soft, water-resistant, and durable, which is why they’re our go-to pick for sweater material.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Wool</a>, which can be found in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Henne Dario Knit</a><strong> </strong>is a highly breathable material that simultaneously has excellent temperature regulation properties, making it ideal for very cold days. Although wool is known at times to be itchy, it still makes a great layering piece. “I make sure to layer a cotton T-shirt underneath since I have sensitive skin,” says Theodora. Leitz also recommends buying a wool sweater with some cashmere mixed in for a softer feel as well as washing the sweater to eliminate the scratchy feel. A great example of this can be found in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Recreational Habits Athos Cropped Turtleneck Sweater</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cashmere, on the other hand, is famous for its extraordinarily soft fibers.

There’s an endless amount of ways you can weave the material to create a worthwhile affordable option that provides both warmth and durability. “Sometimes we tend to sweat during winter beneath our thick coats, and cotton is known for its absorbing features,” says Leitz.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There is no right or wrong fit for a sweater — it’s all about what you feel most comfortable in — however, you should think about when you plan to wear it. For a casual everyday piece, go for a crewneck, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Everlane The Cashmere Crew</a>, that can be worn to just about any occasion.

Keep them in a cool, dry place, especially if stored for a long period of time. We even suggest investing in items like <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cedar blocks</a> to store them in order to naturally keep moths away (and prevent your clothes from being chewed apart).&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What’s the best way to wash a sweater?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Depending on the material the sweater is made of, it may come with a few complicated washing instructions. Nobody likes to have their favorite sweater shrink in the dryer, or worse, pill and lose its soft texture. For this reason, you’ll want to make sure you follow the label’s instructions on how to wash your sweater before mindlessly tossing it into the machine with the rest of your clothes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cashmere is notoriously known for its disdain of washers and dryers — make sure to bring it to the dry cleaners in order to maintain its pristine condition. You’ll also want to hand wash anything that contains acrylic, as this fabric is susceptible to shrinkage in high heat. Meanwhile, wool items can typically be machine washed, so long as you are using a cold or room-temperature setting. As a matter of fact, it can help to take out some of the itchiness that’s associated with this material.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How would you style a sweater?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, this answer depends on what style of sweater you choose. “I love styling my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>turtleneck sweaters</a> with big silver jewelry, micro miniskirts, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>black tights</a>, and fun chunky boots,” says Julia Fox’s stylist Briana Andalore. When it comes to oversized sweaters, Leitz likes to “style an oversized fluffy sweater with jeans, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Chelsea boots</a>, a big woolen scarf in a beautiful popping color like purple.” While balancing out a loose-fitted top with a form-hugging bottom is always a safe go-to, I personally love to go for a top-to-bottom baggy attire. Oversized on top of oversized can get sloppy quickly, so pairing it with a nice blazer or polished shoes is vital.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bianca Kratky</a> is a commerce writer for InStyle with three years of experience covering fashion and lifestyle products.
