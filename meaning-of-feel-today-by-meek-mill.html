<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Meaning of Feel Today* by Meek Mill</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Meek Mill's song titled 'Feel Today' is a captivating and introspective track that delves into the artist's emotions and mindset. The overall theme of the song revolves around the pursuit of success, material wealth, and the challenges that come with it. Meek Mill's lyrics, coupled with Roddy Ricch's featured verse, encapsulate the desire for financial gains, incessant hustling, and the inner conflicts one faces along the way.One standout line from the song is, "I wanna ride the Wraith, bitch, your Rollie fake, it's cloudy in the face." This lyric reflects the idea that Meek Mill wants to achieve the highest level of success, as symbolized by riding in the luxury car known as the Wraith. The reference to a fake Rolex represents the notion that there are often obstacles in the pursuit of success. Meek Mill alludes to the cloudy face of the watch, metaphorically illustrating the challenges and dishonesty that can cloud one's path to achieving their dreams.Another notable lyric is, "All I worry 'bout is money and the drip all day." This line emphasizes the artist's preoccupation with wealth and his stylish appearance. While it may seem materialistic on the surface, this lyric explores the deeper desire for financial stability and the confidence gained from looking and feeling good. The pursuit of wealth is often intertwined with the aspiration to escape the struggles of poverty and create a better life.Roddy Ricch's verse adds depth to the song's themes, particularly when he raps, "Roddy Ricch, all a nigga do is Crip all day." Here, he references his affiliation with the Crips, a notorious street gang. This lyric sheds light on the challenges one faces growing up in a neighborhood plagued by violence and crime. It delves into the constant battle between loyalty to one's roots and the desire to break free from the shackles of a dangerous environment.Furthermore, Meek Mill includes the line, "R.I.P..." without completing the phrase. This incomplete thought invites the listener to reflect on mortality, perhaps alluding to the sacrifices one makes in the pursuit of success. It serves as a reminder that while achieving fame and wealth may be the focus, the struggle can also come at a cost.These standout lyrics work together to build upon the overarching theme of the song. 'Feel Today' is not merely a glorification of material wealth and success but an exploration of the complexities and challenges that accompany such aspirations. Perhaps the unexpected and imaginative themes alluded to in the lyrics, such as the cloudy Rolex face and the affiliation with the Crips, aim to provide narrative depth and showcase the multidimensional aspects of Meek Mill's journey.Ultimately, 'Feel Today' encourages listeners to reflect on their own aspirations, the sacrifices they are willing to make, and the challenges they may encounter along the way. It serves as a reminder that success is not a linear path but a constant battle between ambition, the external forces at play, and the internal conflicts one must overcome.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyuscSkZKahnKF8rrHAp6Cnn12ks26yxJ6jZqyfma66ecGyZKadlaB6rrXLpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-firming-body-lotions.html><span>←</span><span>12 firming body lotions that are like a bootcamp for your bod - and yes, they actually work</span></a>
