Another user tweeted, “Swizz Beatz when he see Alicia Keys and Usher.” One more user wrote, “I know alicia got butterflies when usher hug her from behind 😭.” A netizen also brushed off, “Usher don’t care who wife who gf he gone do what he wanna do lmaoooo,” <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/itscloudnai/status/1756853368134230451 rel=nofollow>they wrote</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/usher-alicia-keys.jpg><p>As for Usher’s wife’s reaction to the Alicia Keys collab, she hasn’t responded yet. E! reported that Usher <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id="eonline.com/news/1394986/usher-and-longtime-love-jenn-goicoechea-get-marriage-license-ahead-of-super-bowl-halftime-show?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dhfacebook&utm_content=app.dashhudson.com/enews/library/media/378623246">married his long-term</a> girlfriend Jennifer Goicoechea days before the Super Bowl. The he senior vice president of A&R at Epic Records has been with Usher since 2019 and together they share 2 children together as well as 2 sons from Usher’s previous relationships. She has shown continuous and unconditional support for Usher throughout his career milestones. In an <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/boogsneffect/>Instagram story</a> hours before the Super Bowl, she wrote “GOD really doing his big one.” She was also seen at Usher’s Super Bowl party where the duo had quite an entrance.</p><p>“Congrats to the newlyweds in the building!” producer Bryan-Michael Cox shouted the couple out as they entered USHER x Rémy Martin Post-Performance Dinner Party held at Cathédrale Las Vegas. The two were wearing matching white outfits—Usher wearing a regal fur cape while his new wife Jennifer was wearing an off-shoulder white top and baggy white pants.</p><p>“Listen, when you find someone that you know is a great partner, of course it is an honor and a pleasure to be able to share life with someone who wants to share it with you and loves you, who you are,” the singer told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People</a>&nbsp;earlier this week, later adding, “We’ve obviously made a commitment to life for life together because of our children. It wouldn’t be odd for us to get married. We already did here. You know what I’m saying?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Usher-Jennifer-Goicoechea.jpg><p>“And we’re going to be in each other’s lives until we die, obviously, because we have something to share,” he added. “That’s beautiful. Our children. But not because of that. I really do feel like I have an amazing partner that I respect.”</p><p>As for Alicia’s husband’s reaction, he poked fun at the performance. Swizz Beats, who Alicia married in 2010 posted an Instagram slideshow of other pictures of Alicia’s Super Bowl performance, showed Usher with his arms around Alicia. Swizz seemed to nod to the discussion around Alicia and Usher’s Super Bowl performance<a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3PkXPEuIsy/?img_index=1" rel=nofollow> in the caption</a>. “Y’all talking about the wrong damn thing !!! y’all don’t see that amazing dress covering the entire stadium ⚡️🚨😂😂😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 Tonight’s performance was nothing but amazing with 2 amazing Giants ! Congrats @usher and my love @aliciakeys that song is a classic 🤍 We don’t do negative vibes on this side we make history ✌🏽 Go see GIANTS at @brooklynmuseum it’s open until July blessings 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,” he wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lmpucm1pZMK0tMSrZLChlpp6orjInKCaZZuaxrR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiny-pomeranian-dog-online-sensation-html.html><span>←</span><span>Tiny Pomeranian dog becomes an online sensation</span></a>
