 Scientists have found many fruit juices and squashes contain too much antimony, a potentially lethal substance. (Posed by model)
Fruit juices drunk by millions of children each day could contain a harmful chemical linked to cancer, scientists have warned.
Researchers have found high levels of antimony - which can be lethal in large doses - in many popular brands."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

It is a silvery-white semi-metal that is also used in electronics and flame-proofing materials. Furthermore, it can be used as a medicine to treat people infected with parasites. The recommended EU limit for antimony in drinking water is five micrograms per litre. However, no limits exist for foodstuffs.<br>Levels above this could cause nausea and vomiting however the effects of long-term exposure are unknown.</p><p>'However we cannot be sure that the antimony levels are harmless.</p><p>'It would be a good idea to have some more research to get a better impression of what the antimony limit should be in fruit drinks.</p><p>'You would have to drink a lot of blackcurrant juice to go beyond the recommended maximum dose which is why there's no antimony limits for drinking water or soft drinks.</p><p>'But we can't be sure the high level we&nbsp; found is not harmful.'</p><p>The Royal Society of Chemistry added: 'Marketing, certainly for the cordial products, is geared towards children. It's a children's drink.</p><p>'This means they are more likely to drink it and more likely to be at risk.'</p><p>The scientists looked at 42 different red fruit juice drinks from Denmark, Scotland and Greece including blackcurrant, strawberry, raspberry and sour cherry and found concentrations 17 times higher than previously studied.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/03/01/article-1254534-0884627B000005DC-946_233x160.jpg height=160 width=233 alt="Soft Drinks.jpg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p style=text-align:left class=imageCaption>Fruit juices and juice drinks are safe, said a spokesman.
