They go to Paris, London, but they rarely go to the Mediterranean or other places where yachting is considered a way of life. So we have to show it to our customers," Tirelli said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Hong Kong, Ferretti would invite Chinese customers and their families on a one-day tour, giving them a taste of the privacy and relaxation they could enjoy out at sea, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Super yachts are far less popular than luxury cars and private jets among China's swelling ranks of billionaires. Of some 4,800 super yachts around the world in 2013, only 34 were in mainland China, according to a New Zealand government estimate.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese yacht owners prefer to use their vessels as social venues to meet friends or business partners but seldom go for long trips. To adapt to their preferences, Ferretti has built larger cabins in their boats and cut the number of bedrooms while adding karaoke and cigar rooms.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"[Chinese people] may spend tens of millions of yuan on a private jet as it's a useful transport tool. But yachts are just an unfamiliar pastime to them," said China Rendez-Vous founder Lawrence Wang Dafu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since the central government launched its anti-graft crackdown in 2013, some Chinese buyers have also turned to overseas markets such as Singapore to buy their super yachts.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ewa Stachurska, marketing manager of Asia's leading yacht agency Simpson Marine, said many bought their yachts overseas also to avoid paying the 43.6 per cent tax levied on imported boats in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chinese consumers' demand was evolving, she said. "In the past, it was much about bling bling. But now … when we recommend Chinese-style designs to our customers, they tell us, 'Don't treat me like a Chinese. I want my boat like those everywhere else'," Stachurska said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Boat show pushto make yachting'cool' in China</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyuu82esGavlZa5tbSOmqmtoZOhsnB9l3FsaXBnZLCptc2aZKudnpmyu3nVqKysZZKkrrV50qGmsGWgqsCpecyaop5lqZawqcDIp55mm5%2BkuW6tzKiloA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./7-must-have-tools-for-mobile-phone-repair.html><span>←</span><span>7 Tools for Mobile Phone Repair, and Tips for Using Them</span></a>
