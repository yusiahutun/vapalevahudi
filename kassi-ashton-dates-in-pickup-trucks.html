Although climbing up in a truck and finding a backroad to drive down isn't a novel concept in country music, Ashton's approach feels fresh. Coincidentally, the song points out the monotony of this small town date.

Ashton maintains an easy, breezy, R&B vibe that pairs perfectly with her rich, soulful voice. Toss those into a shaker glass with just a dash of steel guitar and the song feels as refreshing as the cold beer she's looking for in the opening lines.</p><p>Ashton wrote "Dates in Pickup Trucks" and produced the song alongside Luke Laird and David Garcia.</p><p>Despite it being her first song to hit country radio,&nbsp;Ashton&nbsp;was named to CMT's Next Women of Country class in 2017. Her country music influences are <a href=#>Hank Williams</a>, <a href=#>Loretta Lynn</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Reba McEntire</a>, but she says others outside of the genre&nbsp;— including Adele, Amy Winehouse and Beyonce&nbsp;— also resonate with her.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The Best Country Singer From Every State</h2>Some states, like Oklahoma and Texas, are loaded with famous country singers.
