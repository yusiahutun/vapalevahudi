I opted for <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Amazon’s £19 / $22 hair oil massager tool</a></span>, a rechargeable head massager which uses the combination of red light therapy with gentle micro-current massage to stimulate the hair’s follicles, all while distributing an oil to the scalp. It’s a lot to take in, but as someone who uses a hair growth oil most nights (<span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Fable & Mane at the moment</a></span>) – but rarely massages the oil into my scalp properly, despite knowing that's what you're meant to do – this seemed like a winner. Read on for my review.</p><h2 data-gid=eQUF5h5qzA><strong data-gid=erTgER7YV4n>Amazon LED hair loss treatment tool - first thoughts</strong></h2><p id=ewohQrACFs4 data-wc=60>I was quite surprised at how flimsy it looked, when I first opened the parcel. It’s definitely not going to win any awards for being a stylish beauty device, but for ease of use? Top marks. It’s self-explanatory; you pour your hair oil into the spout, pop the cover back on and remove the secondary cover, protecting the massage prongs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2bcd8e8bad8b-amazon-led-head-massager.jpg><p id=e23-_L3t68 data-wc=47>There’s a soft button to press for three seconds to turn the tool on, and three settings; the first uses massage and light therapy, the second just massage and the third just light therapy, all of which distribute the oil while you move it across your scalp.</p><p id=e2taAADAgkE data-wc=44>I opted for the first setting, wanting to use both massage and light therapy to give my hair some loving. I poured in around 5ml of hair oil, which the instructions suggested, and it took a good 5-6 minutes to use the oil up.</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bc4550e3f000-amazon-hair-tool.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>£18.99 at Amazon</p></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>$21.99 (save 15%) at Amazon</p></a><p id=eNf1zjQMHoa data-wc=43>The massage itself is quite firm, and you soon get used to the firmer pressure on your scalp. It actually becomes pretty relaxing after a minute or two, and I can imagine the massage would feel amazing to relieve a headache or hangover.</p><p id=ebKsvlJG7f data-wc=76>I definitely used too much oil the first few times, and started following the instructions on the hair oil I was using (two pipettes worth of oil) rather than trying to fill the oil chamber on the device. You can pour out any excess oil afterwards, but it’s worth experimenting with amounts to minimise waste. I'd recommend you empty it after each use, as I didn't and found hair oil spilled over my bedside table. Oops.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2f9442005835-hair-loss-shampoos.jpg><p id=egJOC--NvA8 data-wc=70>I moved the device over my hair throughout the use, changing from making small circles with it on the scalp to almost 'combing' it through my hair. It never became tangled in my hair (possibly because of my finer hair) nor got too hot, or too intense to handle. The charge holds for quite a while. I’ve used it around 15 times now, and not had to recharge it yet.</p><h2><strong>Amazon LED<strong data-gid=e7ur6CEQoHd>&nbsp;hair loss treatment tool</strong> – final thoughts</strong></h2><p id=eLAL3dlNYy- data-wc=35>Less <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>hair loss</a>, and more hair growth, were my hopes and dreams for this tool. Can I say it’s delivered? I can’t not, but it’s hard to pinpoint whether it’s down to the device alone.</p><p id=eQrsW-VOPTC data-wc=41>I’ve seen less hair fall since using this to apply my usual hair oil. It’s forced me take the time to massage the oil in, rather than just dropping drops onto my scalp and giving it a cursory 5 second massage.</p><p id=eV5hQ_Lerbz data-wc=48>It’s silkier, less dry and does feel thicker, especially around my scalp. It’s helped me to form good hair habits, and now my nightly head massage with it is just as part of my nightly beauty routine as it is removing my makeup and applying a night serum.</p><p id=ePAaQiMMluc data-wc=42>I think the key to making this work is consistency (isn’t everything with beauty?) and a good hair oil; I’ve not yet tried it with the viral <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>rosemary hair oil</a> my colleague Sophie swears by, but that’ll be next on my list.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">LED for hair growth - what the experts say</h3><p id=e320B62LsP>Does LED really work for hair growth? Kimberley Medd, the Clinic Lead at <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">Face The Future</a></span>, suggests it does - or at least, helps the scalp to stay healthy and the hair strong.</p><p id=e_PIY39p-I>"As we age our scalp health declines due to decreased blood flow, genetics, stress and other lifestyle factors. The LED redlight can be used as a non-invasive phototherapy for hair growth, by emitting energy-producing packets of light deep into the scalp's skin layer. The light creates ATP (cellular energy) which stimulates hair production by strengthening cells, reducing inflammation, increasing blood flow so the hair follicles expand so hair can become thicker and new hairs grow from these new open hair follicles.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXmIc3qamN>“LED light can be absorbed by the scalp due to a substance called cytochrome-c, an intracellular enzyme that when reached by the red light therapy, it can send signals to the scalp for hair health maintenance."</p><p id=eYU_9_iYjU>She added that there are many clinical studies showing that LED red light does in fact, work. “There are many studies on LED for hair loss, with a conclusion that LED red light has the most efficacy for hair grow stimulation and reversal of AGA (androgenetic alopecia). Although you can get LED devices at home to treat hair loss, you can maximise your results by going to a professional for treatment."</p><p id=erlrYXK9Wk>"Just as LED can give your skin a boost, it can re-invigorate your hair," she adds.</p><h2 data-gid=eCwDq0QsPQ0><strong data-gid=e0qcw0OIT0>What is light therapy?</strong></h2><p id=eGNhMLzUrf3 data-wc=85>Light therapy, for the uninitiated, has been a beauty buzzword for the past five years or so and comes in the form of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>LED face masks</a>, light therapy beds and LED wands; the technology, founded by NASA who studied the effect of LED in promoting wound healing, uses low-level lights of differing colours to target areas of the skin. In terms of beauty, red light therapy is lauded for its anti-aging effects, helping to brighten the skin, reduce wrinkles, redness and help the skin glow.&nbsp;</p><p id=eF7kShqYuME data-wc=53>I’ve been a fan of LED face masks for the past four years, having treated myself to one from <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopenernofollow nofollow">The Light Salon</a></span> after visiting the salon in person every week for a few months to heal acne wounds. It also helped that the likes of Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian advocate for them!&nbsp;</p><p id=e0XHXYSkjwZ data-wc=34>Now, I can’t be without it and wear it 3-4 times a week. I’ve found it really does help my skin to stay glowing, but it’s the redness and inflammation it’s really helped with.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The best hair-loss shampoos - with expert tips on preventing thinning hair" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/2f9442005835-hair-loss-shampoos.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The best hair-loss shampoos - with expert tips on preventing thinning hair" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The best hair-loss shampoos - with expert tips on preventing thinning hair</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="10 best scalp scrubs for the cleanest, healthiest hair of your life" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="10 best scalp scrubs for the cleanest, healthiest hair of your life" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>10 best scalp scrubs for the cleanest, healthiest hair of your life</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm 41 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm 41 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm 41 and I tried The Ordinary’s TikTok skincare hack - here's my honest opinion</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
