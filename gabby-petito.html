Her mother’s name is Nichole Schmitt, her father’s name is Joe Petito, and her stepfather’s name is Joseph Schmitt. Her family is a sweet, happy family, but her departure has left her mother and father disturbed and lonely.

He chose to become a YouTuber rather than attend college, and she enjoys her work.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Gabby Petito</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>March 18, 1999</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>22 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Long Island, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>YouTuber</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Pisces</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Gabby_Petito-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Gabby Petito- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Gabby has been dating Brian Laundrie since March of this year. Both had known one other since they were in elementary school, but they only began dating in 2019. According to speculations and pictures on Instagram, they are engaged. Brian proposed to Gabby in July 2020 for Marriage Proposal, and she said those three precious words – “YES.” Aside from that, there were reports in high school that she was engaged to her high school classmate in 2020.</p><h2><span id=The_Incident>The Incident</span></h2><p>Gabby, 22, of Blue Point, Long Island, was last seen on August 24th, when she and her two-and-a-half-year partner, Brian Laundrie, checked out of a hotel in Salt Lake City. Her family reported her missing on September 11th evening, according to officials. Family members and police are searching for a New Yorker who went missing while traveling across the country with her companion. Her partner abandoned her, and she hasn’t been heard from in weeks. Ms. Petito and Mr. Laundrie had been documenting their “van-life” voyage through the United States on the YouTube channel “Nomadic Statik.” She FaceTimed her mother on a regular basis, but when she didn’t hear from her in days, she became concerned and alerted the authorities.</p><h2><span id=Authorities8217_Statement>Authorities’ Statement</span></h2><p>According to a press release from the Suffolk County Police Department, Gabby’s family last interacted with her at the end of August 21. Gabby, according to her mother, FaceTimed at least three to four times every week. Between August 26 and 27, her mother got text messages from Gabby’s phone, but she wasn’t sure if they were from her daughter. Because it was only a text, I’m not sure if it was technically her or not. “I didn’t talk to her verbally,” she said in an interview with CBS News.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_her>What happened to her?</span></h2><p>At the time of the last communication, this young woman was expected to be in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park. Gabby’s mother, Nicole Schmidt, told Fox News that the two were on their way to Yellowstone National Park, but her daughter did not arrive. “When I didn’t hear back from her for several days, I assumed she was stuck somewhere without service.” Mrs Schmidt stated that she became anxious after a week. The circumstances of her disappearance “were strange,” according to police in Florida, where the pair had previously lived. The North Port Police Department said in a statement, “The North Port Police Department is actively assisting the matter in collaboration with the Suffolk County Police Department where she was reported missing.”</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p><strong>Gabby Petito stands 5 ft 0 inches tall and weighs 49 kg</strong>.
