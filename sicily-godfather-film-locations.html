It's now <strong>40 years since the first of the three films was released</strong>, so why not celebrate the anniversary by taking a trip to the pretty <span>Italian</span> island to discover the <strong>locations that played a part in this silver screen classic</strong>?</p><p id=eKmh9PH8Gt7m data-wc=45><strong>The largest, and arguably the most beautiful, of the <span>Mediterranean</span> islands</strong>, Sicily has two undeniable claims to fame: its associations – both real and fictional – with the , and the fact that it is home to <strong>Etna, the tallest active volcano in Europe</strong>.</p><p id=ezEEC1-UAYKu data-wc=87>In the heart of the island in <strong>a labyrinth of hills dotted with olive groves and carpeted with wheat fields</strong>, the town of <strong>Corleone</strong> shares its name with <strong>Don Vito Corleone, the patriarch of the dynasty</strong>, portrayed on screen as an old man by the great <strong>Marlon Brando</strong>, and in his younger days by <a class=hm-link href=#>Robert de Niro</a>. By a strange quirk of fate, Corleone is also the home town of the grandparents of <a class=hm-link href=#>Al Pacino</a>, who played <strong>Michael, Don Vito's youngest son</strong> and successor as head of the family business.</p><p id=el6TgB5N5VQY data-wc=72>It would seem, then, that this is where we should start our search for the locations of the <strong>silver-screen masterpiece</strong> that catapulted <strong>director Francis Ford Coppola</strong> to fame. In fact, though, when filming was started on the first film, the town was already too big to represent rural Sicily of the time referred to in <strong>Mario Puzo's novel</strong> and locations were found in the more <strong>rustic settings of Savoca and Forza d’Agro</strong>.</p><p id=efO0bfAf7nlh data-wc=103>Listed recently <strong>among Italy's most beautiful towns, Sovaca</strong>, with its sloping cobbled streets, is home to one of the most iconic settings of : <strong>the bar </strong><strong>, where Michael meets Apollonia</strong>, the beautiful young daughter of the owner and the woman he later marries. Over the forty years since the first filming, the has changed little: it remains <strong>a small village tavern with seats out under a vine</strong>, and still serves – the lemon ice sorbet that Coppola and his crew enjoyed in the hot summer of 1971, while inside, <strong>a collection of old photos recall the filming</strong>.</p><p id=ewwbxyJcwFs2 data-wc=62>To walk through the scenes for yourself, just take a walk through the Old Town, up to the <strong>church of San Nicolo where the couple married on screen</strong>. Confusingly, the ancient fortress-like monument is also known as the <strong>church of Santa Lucia</strong>, but anyone in the village will direct you to “” – the church of</p><p id=exL4VZNxmBVI data-wc=93>A scant 12 kilometres away, <strong>a stone's throw from the sea</strong>, is the equally delightful <strong>mountain village of&nbsp; Forza d’Agro</strong>. Here fans will recognise the , the <strong>churches of Sant’Antonio, Santa Maria Annunziata and la Trinita</strong>, and <strong>the austere Augustinian Convent</strong>, that feature in such notable scenes as the first time Michael enters the town of Corleone with his bodyguard, as well as the flash-back in which <strong>the young Vito, hidden among the donkey's load</strong> escapes the henchmen of local Don Ciccio, after all the rest of his family have been killed.</p><p id=exvovkm2RCkA data-wc=93>Other scenes that supposedly take place in Corleone, were set in <strong>Motta Camastra</strong>, while the train station where Michael greets his ex-wife Kay, played by <a class=hm-link href=#>Diane Keaton</a>, is not Bagheria, as stated in the film, but the much more impressive structure in <strong>the pretty tourist town of Taormina</strong>. And if you want to find the place where Michael's car explodes with the unfortunate Apollonia inside, you'll have to go to <strong>Castello degli Schiavi, a veritable jewel of rural Sicilian baroque</strong>, the setting, too, for the death of Michael at the end of the saga.</p><p id=eh2eQD-jPAxY data-wc=121>Just before this last scene, though, there is <strong>one of the most memorable points of the trilogy</strong>, when Michael and his family attend the opera debut of his son Anthony and <strong>the bullet intended to kill him instead takes the life of his daughter Mary</strong>. This scene was filmed on the steps of the <strong>nineteenth-century Teatro Massimo in Palermo</strong>, alongside Naples, perhaps the most infamous of Italian cities. <strong>Palermo, the Sicilian capital</strong>, boasts an amazing Old Town with bustling squares and market places, <strong>grand baroque bell towers, and decadent </strong><strong>and mansions</strong>, and through the streets pass a whole army of real-life characters whose pasts it is easy to imagine might hold such turbulent stories as that of the Corleone family.</p><p id=eT5aNmxMwPIe data-wc=2><strong>THE PRACTICALITIES</strong></p><p id=eL231lSETLYa data-wc=16><strong>Best time to visit</strong>The summer heat can be overwhelming; spring and autumn are the best seasons.</p><p id=eLsnyU2acruL data-wc=53><strong>Getting there & getting around</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Easyjet</a> have direct flights from London to Palermo and Catania; <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Ryanair</a> fly to Palermo from Stanstead. Alternatively, fly to Milan or Rome and transfer to a local flight. There's so much to see and do on the island that it's a good idea to rent a car to get around.</p><p id=eIGJNx2pxoo7 data-wc=28><strong>The movie trail</strong>Among the companies who organise visits to filming locations, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sicily Travel</a> offer private tours from around 50 € per person for a minimum of five people.</p><p id=e84pcCF_I_bU data-wc=2><strong>Learn more</strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Tourism in Sicily</a><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Italian Tourism</a>&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
