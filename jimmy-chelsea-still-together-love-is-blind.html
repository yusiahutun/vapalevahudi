The answer is no. Jimmy Presnell and Chelsea Blackwell broke up in the Love Is Blind Season 6 finale. They were one of five couples who got engaged in The Pods on Love Is Blind Season 6, along with AD and Clay; Jeramey and Laura; Brittany and Kenneth; and Johnny and Amy.&nbsp;</p><p>Before their engagement, Jimmy and Chelsea were involved in a love square with Jess Vestal and Trevor Sova, other contestants on Love Is Blind Season 6. Jimmy broke up with Jess once he chose Chelsea. Chelsea, for her part, then broke up with Trevor once she learned that Jimmy had chosen her. So are Jimmy and Chelsea still together from Love Is Blind Season 6? At the time of writing this, both Jimmy and Chelsea follow each other. Jimmy has also liked several of Chelsea’s posts from December 2023 to February 2024 when Love Is Blind Season 6 premiered. Chelsea, for her part, has only liked one of Jimmy’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> posts from him in New York City in January 2024.</p><p>Chelsea and Jimmy broke up in the Love Is Blind Season 6 finale right before their wedding. “The whole process has made me realize so much about myself. I’m so so different now,”&nbsp;Chelsea told <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.eonline.com/news/1396220/love-is-blinds-chelsea-shares-what-wasnt-shown-in-jimmy-romance>E! News</a> after the Love Is Blind finale aired. “All of us have a type of insecurity that we’re trying to work past and mine were just very heightened. It’s such a different, unique experience. How can you be secure in that situation? You can’t. There’s no way. So, I handled things a lot differently.”</p><p>Chelsea’s posts that Jimmy has liked includes a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Christmas selfie</a> in December 2023 and two Love Is Blind Season 6 promotional posts in January and February 2024, including Chelsea’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>announcement</a> that she was on Love Is Blind Season 6. “It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me. Jk…tune in Feb 14th to find out! Only on Netflix! 💕 #loveisblind #netflix,” she captioned the post. What’s more interesting is that, at the time of writing this, Jimmy follows both Jess and Trevor. Chelsea, for her part, also follows both Jess and Trevor. Jess and Trevor also both follow Jimmy and Chelsea.&nbsp;</p><p>Before the Love Is Blind Season 6 reunion, TMZ posted a video where a fan spotted Jimmy with his arm around&nbsp;Chelsea. Though fans believed they were still together, Chelsea and Jimmy confirmed at the Love Is Blind Season 6 reunion that they are not back together, though they did reunite for a few days before splitting for good. “We tried to date for four days after filming was done,” Chelsea said. “It was very short-lived.”</p><p>Chelsea continued, “He called me one day and nothing really changed in that little time period, and I thought maybe it would’ve because the cameras weren’t involved, maybe we really could make this work. ur connection was so strong and I gave it a chance and he called me four days later and said, ‘This experiment made me realize I don’t want a relationship.’” She added, “And I’m like, ‘Sir, you do realize we were going to get married?’ He was honest and his feelings were valid.”</p><p>Jimmy, for his part, explained why he and Chelsea didn’t get back together. “We tried for a bit, but just nothing really came of it,” he explained, adding that they spent time together “every single day” after filming ended. “[We] sort of got right back into it, zero to 100 once again and we had fun during that time.” In the end, Jimmy realized that Chelsea exposing major “skeletons in [his] closet” during Love Is Blind made him not want to continue their relationship.</p><p>“She broke a level of my trust. She wanted me to sort of validate how she felt about it, and I will validate how you feel about it a hundred percent of the time, but let’s validate … not on camera,” he said. “And so we were sort just having that same argument over and over again, and we both just kind came to an agreement that it wasn’t going to work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfn7auudhmmqGdnKiyonnSraClpF2pvKix06Gcq2WcpMOmecisZJukmaOxcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./efficient-mortgage-business-growth.html><span>←</span><span>Utilizing Technology For Efficient Mortgage Business Growth</span></a>
