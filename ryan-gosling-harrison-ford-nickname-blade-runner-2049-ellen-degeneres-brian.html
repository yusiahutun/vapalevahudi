"I hope that's a nickname."</p><p>"I don't think it is. I think he thinks your name is Brian," the comedian responded.</p><p>Ford, who was the original star of Ridley Scott's 1982 classic science fiction movie "Blade Runner," had a UK late-night audience cracking up while struggling to refer to his co-star with the correct name.</p><p>"They finally came up with a good story. And as I read it, I read about the character, that umm -- Ry, Ryan?" Harrison said as he turned to Gosling.</p><p>"It's Ryan," Gosling said in response.</p><p>As Ford tried to recover himself and continue his story, he got caught in the same trap again not only forgetting the actor's first and last name, but also thinking Gosling said "Rosling."</p><p>Moments later Ford finally remembered Gosling's name, but checked back to confirm he had it right.</p><p>"Ryan, um Ryan, Ryan Gosling," Ford said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7673147b-52b5-594a-afb8-1cc58572b9f3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:971653c2-2466-59db-8262-96b1edf81ea4 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3a/5by4/2017/10/06/3a44d352b8985907bd8310b8c2b68fda_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty, Warner Brothers</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ryan Gosling Talking About His Dog on 'Ellen' Is Everything That's Right in This World</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In a more recent must-see interview overseas, a British TV personality <strong><a href=#>had both movie stars in stitches</a></strong> after blurted out she'd never seen the original "Blade Runner."</p><p>"Bleak.
