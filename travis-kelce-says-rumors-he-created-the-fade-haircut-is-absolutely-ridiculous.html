He seemed quite unimpressed at the fact <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an article</a> surfaced seemingly crediting the style of his hair to him, despite the fact the do has been around for several years.</p><p>“It’s ridiculous. I got a good fade if you need it, though. It’s a two on top and a nice high-to-mid fade with a taper in the back. I didn’t invent that. I just asked for it,” he said.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Travis Kelce ‘taking a step back’ from things that don’t involve football – including the Grammys</a></p><p>On the subject of the article that was published, he said: “They throw me into the wolves like that,” Kelce joked during the press conference.</p><p>“That was messed up, man.

He reaffirmed his belief he was being credited with creating the fade cut was silly and said he “didn’t want anything to do with this.”</p><p>“This is ridiculous, unbelievable,” the Kansas City Chiefs player says as his brother reads out the New York Times headline. “Oh my God! This is what it said?!” he asked when Jason read an excerpt that compared the Travis hair craze to that of Jennifer Aniston.</p><p>“Who the f*** is in quotes saying this?” Travis asked looking very puzzled.</p><p>He then read a stat quoted in the piece, which claims a barber in Canada received “50 requests” for the haircut.</p><p>“They’re just quoting one barber,” points out Jason. “Before that, it says barbers in America and abroad … they’re asking for the Travis Kelce overseas.”</p><p>“Thanks for whoever wrote this article,” Travis said while not looking best pleased. “I had more barbers attack me for not even having anything to do with it! Like I didn’t want anything to do with this.”</p><p>After Jason sarcastically quipped Travis “invented the fade” his brother was quick to retort “No I didn’t.”</p><p>“What better month to credit a white man with inventing the fade than February,” Jason said dryly.</p><p>“On the first [of Black History Month], too. I didn’t want anything to do with this,” Travis repeated, “I saw this, and I said, ‘No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This isn’t real. This isn’t true.”</p><p>“I didn’t invent the fade, but I know where you can get a good one,” he concluded.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-is-actually-a-man-with-style-we-ll-have-you-know>Travis is actually a man with style, we’ll have you know</h2><p>After he began dating the <a href=#>music</a> star, Travis Kelce’s hairstyle and fashion have gained attention online. His stylist Danielle Salzedo told US Weekly she likes to find clothes the <a href=#>celebrity</a> will feel comfortable in rather than something he wouldn’t, even if it was trendy.</p><p>“Travis has a clear vision for his personal aesthetic and definitely styles himself. He dedicates time to buying online, so he knows what’s out there and what’s new. I know what he likes, and I find him options with brands we know are his vibe – while also looking for new ones yet to be discovered.”</p><p>She continued: “He doesn’t shy away from mixing prints in unexpected ways.”</p><p>Though we think <a href=#>Tay Tay has influenced her beau’s dress sense</a>, he has admitted he doesn’t really care if someone calls him a “clown” for what he chooses to wear.</p><p>He previously told the Wall Street Journal: “Obviously, not every look is for everybody,” he continued. “I’m not going to be offended if somebody says I look like a clown if I got a fun hat on and some wacky jeans. It is what it is, I’m gonna have fun with it.”</p><p>He’s very serious about his fashion choices, too, as he told the publication it takes him “at least three hours” to choose what he’s going to wear that day, especially if it’s a game day.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Travis Kelce is the ‘same guy in the locker room’ after dating Taylor Swift</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WFcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaqmrGjYr%2B2uc6rqmaglWKws7HArZydZaSdsm6ywJ2cZqCRnr%2BkwdNmoKxlkZfAsLjUrZylsV2ntqW1wq6jqK2jZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./this-ai-art-gallery-is-even-better-than-using-a-generator.html><span>←</span><span>This AI Art Gallery Is Even Better Than Using a Generator</span></a>
