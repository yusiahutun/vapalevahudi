Whether it be hair products (shampoos, dry shampoos, bar shampoos...), body products (body lotion, body oil, body serum...), or skincare products (physical exfoliants, chemical exfoliants, hybrid exfoliants), there's plenty to choose from — but makeup seems to be the easiest category to differentiate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Or is it?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Obviously it's easy to tell foundation apart from mascara, but some types of products are trickier to decipher. Take skin tints and tinted moisturizers for example. Both complexion products give our faces your-skin-but-better type finishes, and they are often used interchangeably. However, they're two totally different things.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're trying to understand the difference as you navigate the beauty aisles, we tapped a top celebrity makeup artist to break down everything there is to know.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-tinted-moisturizer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Tinted Moisturizer?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A tinted moisturizer is exactly what it sounds like, a moisturizer that has a tint to it. "They provide sheer to medium coverage, evening out the skin tone while hydrating and moisturizing the skin," says Jason Hoffman, VP of Artistry & Education at Amyris.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hoffman further explains that in order for the product to be considered a tinted moisturizer, it has to moisturize the skin to meet FDA and FTA guidelines. A good example would be the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Meghan Markle-approved </a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Tinted moisturizers come in a variety of formulations that are best used based on your skin type: if you have oily-skin, I recommend using an oil-free tinted moisturizer; if you have acne-prone skin, I recommend using a tinted moisturizer that is non comedogenic; if you have dry skin, I recommend a tinted moisturizer that includes hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, or squalane," says Hoffman. "You can also find tinted moisturizers that come in multiple finishes, including radiant, natural, and matte. Many tinted moisturizers also have SPF, which is great for everyday use and especially during the summer."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-skin-tint></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Skin Tint?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Consider skin tints the sheerer versions of tinted moisturizers. However, they tend to have a texture more similar to a serum than a moisturizer, provide less coverage, and they don't moisturize the skin as much.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They are typically less oily than tinted moisturizers and are the perfect product to achieve a no-makeup makeup look," adds Hoffman. "Skin tints will sometimes have skin-benefiting ingredients like hyaluronic acid, squalane, niacinamide, or more. All skin types can use a skin tint, but if you are acne prone, make sure the product is non comedogenic."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A favorite of his is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Rose Inc Skin Enhance Luminous Tinted Serum</a> as it's non-comedogenic and bridges the gap between powerful skincare and luminous makeup to deliver sheer, radiant coverage. "The pigment spheres are suspended within a skincare base infused with hyaluronic acid to visibly plump and smooth the appearance of fine lines, squalane to weightlessly hydrate the skin, and peptides to help protect against environmental damage," he says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-use-a-tinted-moisturizer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Use a Tinted Moisturizer?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These are particularly great if you have a drier skin type or want to stay on top of your skin's moisture levels without full-coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hoffman says you can apply it with either your fingers, a makeup brush, or a makeup sponge — it's all about preference. "If you're looking for a bit more coverage, you can layer with concealer on top. Then, you can finish your makeup routine with bronzer, blush, mascara or anything else you use," he adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-use-a-skin-tint></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Use a Skin Tint?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Skin tint is great for a no-makeup makeup look, providing just a hint of coverage to make you feel like you're not wearing anything on your face," says Hoffman.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with tinted moisturizers, he says to apply it with either your fingers, a makeup brush, or a makeup sponge — just make sure to apply a moisturizer underneath it so your skin gets those added skincare benefits. If you want more coverage, spot treat with concealer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: The Exact Order You Should Be Applying Your Makeup</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-choose-between-tinted-moisturizer-and-skin-tint></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Choose Between Tinted Moisturizer and Skin Tint:</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Hoffman, it depends on your skin type and the type of result you want. "If you have acne-prone skin, choose a product that's non-comedogenic. If you're currently experiencing a breakout and want to have more coverage, opt for a tinted moisturizer over a skin tint. If you have dry skin, look for a tinted moisturizer or skin tint with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and squalane. If you have oily skin, look for a tinted moisturizer or skin tint that is oil-free," he suggests.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2irm567bsDIp6usZaaoerW1za2cnWWdpLa0wNSroLOdoqg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./natalie-friedman-and-jamie-foxx.html><span>←</span><span>Natalie Friedman and Jamie Foxx</span></a>
