During the recent CinemaCon in Las Vegas, Shawn was asked to comment on the Taylor rumors swirling around the film that the appearance helped stir.</p><p>“That is hardly confirmed nor denied in this interview,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> Entertainment Tonight. “All that’s known is that I went to a football game, and those hours were well-documented and that’s all I’m gonna say.”</p><p>Leaving more room for speculation, he added: “What can I say? I think intrigue is fun.”</p><p>It’s not the first time ET has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a> about the potential for a collaboration with <a href=#>Taylor Swift in connection with the NFL</a> appearance. “That was just a Sunday night hang with some friends that became a lot more,” he earlier argued.</p><p>“I’ll just say that the proliferation of Deadpool [& Wolverine] casting rumors is hilarious, and also really useful because now there’s no way for people to tell what’s real and what’s not. So I can just sit back and just let the wave of accuracy and falsehood wash over me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Currently I think that Taylor Swift will not appear as Dazzler in Deadpool and Wolverine</p><p>But Taylor Swift could still appear in the film and sing a song <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/20wDwITd8w</a></p>— Marvel Updates (@update_marvel) <a href=#>April 6, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-deadpool-amp-wolverine-release-date-comes-after-tay-s-new-album>Deadpool & Wolverine release date comes after Tay’s new album</h2><p>All you Swifties likely already have Friday, April 19th 2024 marked down in your calendars because it marks the release day for the year’s most anticipated album, <a href=#>The Tortured Poets Department</a>, which will be the singer’s eleventh.</p><p>Features from Post Malone and Florence + The Machine have already been confirmed, and you can hear the project in all its glory long before the release of Deadpool & Wolverine on Friday, July 26th later this year.</p><p>Fans aren’t expecting a Deadpool feature on that, but please, Taylor’s induction into the MCU would be so much more than a memorable movie theater moment—the place would erupt.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2Z%2FcLDEmpupp5%2Bheri7y6%2Bcq6GemnqltdGemq2nomKvs7HApKpmq5mhsq%2BvxGamr52iYsGixcuoqWarp56ztXnCmqqtoZ6cerPBzKiprGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amanda-bynes-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Amanda Bynes' Net Worth</span></a>
