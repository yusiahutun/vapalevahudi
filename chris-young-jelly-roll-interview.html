"He's just having such a cool run right now. I remember talking about this music he's putting out [now] well over a year ago."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jelly Roll — whose real name is Jason DeFord — has been riding a new wave of career success over the past year. His 2022 single "Son of a Sinner" climbed to No. 1 on Billboard's Country Airplay chart, marking his first radio hit in the genre since launching his career in 2010.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"It's just amazing to see him having the moment he's having," Young continues. "I think he is kind of that person that [thinks], 'Hey, I can, I can do multiple genres. I can kind of hop back and forth. I just want to create,' and I think not everybody can do that. It's really, really cool."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"He's just worked hard for a really long time. He talks about the struggles he's had in his life and the things he's been through. He is not your normal success story."</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In a&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=#><span data-preserver-spaces=true>recent interview</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=#><span data-preserver-spaces=true>People Every Day</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;podcast, Jelly Roll talked openly about the three-and-a-half years he spent at a juvenile detention center before being charged as an adult for a crime he committed in his youth. During that time behind bars, he discovered his passion for creating music, which he began to pursue after his release.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As he's continued to build a career over the years as a genre-bending artist, Jelly Roll has been determined to use his platform for good. Aside from sharing his own story, the 38-year-old has helped raise thousands to fund the construction of a recording studio at the Davidson County Juvenile Detention Center and even visited and even&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=#><span data-preserver-spaces=true>performed a special show</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;for inmates.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"He's just himself and he's welcoming to everyone else," Young notes.

I was originally supposed to do that before COVID with him when he was going to play the Ryman," he adds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As Young preps a new batch of music, including his latest single, "</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=#><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Looking for You</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>," he says he's open to recording something special with Jelly Roll.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>"Absolutely. I think he may see something from both of us at some point," he teases. "I always say this about collaborations... it's got to be the right song.
