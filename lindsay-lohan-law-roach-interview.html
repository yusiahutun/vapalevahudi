So I wanted to be a part of it.”</p><img alt="celebrity sightings in new york november 09, 2022" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York - November 09, 2022" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lindsay-lohan-is-seen-on-november-09-2022-in-new-york-news-photo-1669063333.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MEGA</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Lindsay Lohan in a gorgeous, vintage-inspired Valentino dress.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the premiere of the film, on November 10, Lohan went super classic, in a nude brocade Valentino column with long sleeves. She looked a bit Liz Taylor, Jet Set fabulous, but not costume-y. She’s also popped up in ensembles that recall the edgy classicism of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, who adored the avant-garde fashion sections of New York’s best department stores, like a black button-up set with a boxy little handbag, and a draped white sleeveless skirt suit with a standup collar, cinched with a gold belt. She got a little racy for an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon in a sleek red pieced-leather Versace cocktail dress—which reminded me that rare is the star nowadays who simply knows what colors and shapes make her look fantastic. The clothes don’t merely imply that the star has it together, that she’s fully an adult—though they certainly telegraph both of those things. Lohan’s Law Roach era also suggests a glamour out of time, a woman who survived with a classicist’s commitment to beauty.</p><img alt="celebrity sightings in new york november 10, 2022" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York - November 10, 2022" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lindsay-lohan-is-seen-on-november-10-2022-in-new-york-news-photo-1669063206.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MEGA</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Lindsay Lohan, looking crisp and classic.</p><img alt="celebrity sightings in new york november 08, 2022" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York - November 08, 2022" width=2118 height=3100 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lindsay-lohan-is-seen-on-november-08-2022-in-new-york-city-news-photo-1669063275.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MediaPunch/Bauer-Griffin</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Lohan in a sculptural white sleeveless skirt suit by Michael Kors Collection.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And yet the press tour for which Roach was enlisted, for the Netflix film Falling for Christmas, is not a comeback. (The film is part of a two-picture creative partnership with the streaming platform.) Instead, Roach saw it as a meeting between two fashion fanatics. “It was really like me dressing a colleague, almost,” he says, because of Lohan’s depth of knowledge about clothes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“One thing I would say about her is that she knows fashion, she knows clothes,” Roach says. “Her taste is exquisite. I actually really, really enjoyed our time together because it’s not that often I really get to have real fashion conversations with clients.” Lohan “has so many incredible relationships with designers—personal relationships with designers—so her knowledge of clothes and construction” is deeper than the average superstar’s.” She was the creative director of Ungaro and a personal friend of Karl Lagerfeld’s, Roach reminds us. “She’s a bit of a fashion historian,” he says, and has an impressive collection of archival fashion, which appeals greatly to Roach, of course, who is known for dressing his clients in stunning vintage pieces, a proclivity which helped kick off the current craze for archival fashion. (Even the dress code at the CFDA awards earlier this month, where Roach was honored, was “Archival American.”)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We had so many things in common,” Roach says, “that it felt like we had known each other for years.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lohan’s team reached out to Roach’s before the press bonanza began, and “I was interested,” he recalls. “I was definitely interested—a thousand percent.” So that whole fracas, where Lohan ragged on Zendaya’s 2019 Met Gala dress for looking too much like Clare Danes’s from a few years prior? It’s all water under the bridge! Back then, Roach was asked about Lohan’s tweets on the red carpet, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/Katie_Krause/status/1126565078390661120 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="and issued the ultimate fashion world snub" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>and issued the ultimate fashion world snub</u></a>: “I don’t know her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“That interview where I said I didn’t know her,” Roach says now. “You know, I wasn’t lying: I didn’t know her. And now I know her! And now I know her enough to know that I really like her.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">“We let the clothes do the talking, actually,” Roach says. “My first fitting with someone, I want to kind of overdo it a bit, right? So I wanna see what they’re naturally drawn to, what the body naturally is drawn to. It’s a lot about the emotion I think clothes evoke when they get on, you know?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Roach first came to the fashion world’s attention as the stylist to Zendaya and Celine Dion, ushering a new era of runway-fluent, over-the-top celebrity style. He brings a kind of glamorous wink to his clients, dressing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.google.com/search?q=celine+dion+vetements&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsZaDfALF0dC7Wz_5T_5XkjP4h1cRw:1669062824768&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiIqJzGj8D7AhWqFVkFHVIaAsUQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1453&bih=691&dpr=2#imgrc=nICRDcu8QIOHsM" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dion in Vetements’s Titanic sweatshirt and Heart of the Ocean necklace" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dion in Vetements’s Titanic sweatshirt and Heart of the Ocean necklace</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.google.com/search?q=ariana+grande+grammys&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsYvH4YkHsVQ7xubtoKqhQeeA9QJWQ:1669062859475&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiy1OLWj8D7AhXsLFkFHW0BAgAQ_AUoAXoECAMQAw&biw=1453&bih=691&dpr=2#imgrc=_JQ_fYYY6h2u7M" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ariana Grande in a giant gray Giambattista Valli dress for the Grammys" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ariana Grande in a giant gray Giambattista Valli dress for the Grammys</a>.

Now, based in Los Angeles, he wakes up daily at four AM and is styling a dozen or so women at any given time, including Zendaya, Megan Thee Stallion, Kerry Washington, and Emma Watson. He’s become a powerful Hollywood-fashion world dealmaker, sculpting Zendaya’s image even in Valentino ad campaigns, and making a case that the image makers should not be behind the scenes but on the arms of their clients.<br></p><img alt="the tonight show starring jimmy fallon season 10" title="The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon - Season 10" width=1998 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/episode-1743-pictured-actress-lindsay-lohan-poses-backstage-news-photo-1669063416.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">NBC</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A perfect red leather Versace.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think more than anything, I’m just a storyteller, right?” Roach says. “And I just try to use the clothes as the words to tell the story. And if someone’s looking to tell a story, for the clothes to be part of the bigger narrative, then I think that’s why they call me.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Among the looks that Roach helped Lohan develop, there is no revenge dress, nothing that reveals a shocking physical makeover. Her hair is gloriously groomed in her classic Veronica Lake sweep and her lips are their signature deep apple red. There is no insistence that she knows and cares deeply about the latest designer trends or moments, but instead, a reliance on classics like Akris and Valentino. She exudes polish, crispness, ladylikeness. She looks like the movie star her fans know she is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The first look together that Roach developed with Lohan was a color block Akris suit with trousers that kicked out at the knee, and a pair of Giuseppe Zannoti pumps, which Lohan wore for an appearance on Good Morning America. “There was something joyous about the Akris,” Roach says. “When she put it on, she smiled, I smiled, and hopefully that’s what the reaction was when people got a chance to see it.” He continues, “It's not so often clothes really can instantly make you do that. And that’s what the beauty about that look was. It was just instantaneously joyful.”<br></p><img alt="celebrity sightings in new york november 08, 2022" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York - November 08, 2022" width=998 height=1567 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lindsay-lohan-is-seen-arriving-to-good-morning-america-on-news-photo-1669063016.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">MEGA</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Lindsay Lohan in a joyful Akris suit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“What people love to say about me is that I’m a risk taker,” Roach muses. “But it’s like, I’m not really the risk taker. The client is more the risk taker than me. I just look for clothes that make you feel something.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Roach says Lohan recently sent him an image that a fan page had made on Instagram of all the looks, and he could see strongly the narrative of clothes they’d built together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Taking the looks in sum, what does it mean, then, to be iconic? Well, Lohan is extraordinarily contemporary figure, in the amount (and type) of infamy and drama she’s overcome. And yet there is something timeless in that, too: a lineage to a more golden, more glamorous era of Hollywood in the push and pull between her suffering and her extraordinary talent. “I can’t wait to see what we do next,” Roach gushes.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/eb92ba9d-3e4d-4650-b9c7-eff7aa4ac591_1647626609.PNG?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rachel Tashjian" title="Headshot of Rachel Tashjian" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
