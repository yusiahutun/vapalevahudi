She follows up with the Lancome 'Blush Subtil Powder' and Lancome 'Hypnose Drama Waterproof Full Impact Volume Mascara,' and tops off her look with the Lancome 'La Nuit Tresor L'Eau de Parfum Spray'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4e3173828bb3-gettyimages-1843525529.jpg><p id=egIZKH4QgM2 data-wc=64>For us mere mortals, using all these products would cost a very pretty penny. Penelope's skincare regime will set you back $225.79 (£181.90) &nbsp;a month, and her makeup and perfume adds a further $289.02 (£231.83) bringing it to a grand total of $515.80 (£413.73) per month. Gulp! If you fancy treating yourself, you can pick up the entire range of Lancome products on Escentual.com.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Penelope's Hair</h2><p id=e0gTup5nNV data-wc=34>Penelope's mane is strong and lucious. We spoke to elite hairdresser Paul Windle of <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Windle Salon</a>, London who thinks the actress has done lots of things to keep her hair intact and looking gorgeous.</p><p id=eBJFQkAIyBE data-wc=61>"As we age, the hair diameter decreases, so it's important to avoid excessive heat styling when not needed; give your hair a break as the heat can erode it. Penelope would have used protein rich shampoo and conditioner to keep her hair strong. Windle Lab fortifying shampoo and conditioner contains protein bonding agents and wheat protein which are great for this."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Penelope's ageless looks&nbsp;</h2><p id=e1IpnQTOO26 data-wc=38>Now, we all know that Hollywood stars often subtly dabble in cosmetic enhancements, but <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Dr Mark Solomos,</a> Plastic & Aesthetic Surgeon as seen on 10 Years Younger and Price of Perfection, thinks she has had very little done.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/55523a1e3ad4-gettyimages-1035779126.jpg><p id=efd-FH4EY67 data-wc=93>"Penelope looks very natural, with no obvious signs of surgical intervention. You can even see some fine lines which is very refreshing in the age of Hollywood perfection, and in my opinion makes her look more beautiful and natural. She may well have had Botox and fillers in the past but nothing too extravagant. Also it’s possible to do mini Botox so you can relax the muscles and lighten the lines without losing the expressions - important for actors! It’s become very popular in my clinic for a light refresh of the skin."</p><p id=e7BsEShXo4z data-wc=13>It seems her lifestyle also plays a major part in her age-defying looks.</p><p id=eU7Zdljm8y8 data-wc=77>The expert added: "Penelope is blessed by good genes and a dark Mediterranean olive skin tone, which usually ages quite well. I am sure she benefits from non surgical interventions like perhaps PRP treatments, profhilo, light therapy and laser as these improve things marginally and give glowing skin without any signs of ‘work’. No doubt she will lead a healthy lifestyle routine with exercise, good nutrition and skin care regime. This is the way to do it!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGxqcGRtgXC8xKecpaegmnqkvtSzZKOto6l6tcHRp5ydZWVleqK6w2aroaGjYra0eceormarmJp6rbvOpKpmnJWYrqWx0mawqK2enLKzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./game-thrones-maisie-williams-goes-braless-sheer-lace-dress-nspcc-summer-masquerade-ball-html.html><span>←</span><span>Maisie Williams at NSPCC Summer Masquerade Ball</span></a>
