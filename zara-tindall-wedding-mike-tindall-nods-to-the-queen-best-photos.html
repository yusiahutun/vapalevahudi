Arriving at the church, Zara Philips looked calm and collected as she and her father Captain Mark Philips entered Canongate Kirk.

Simple yet sculpted, the shape of the graceful gown accentuated her enviable silhouette and gave centre stage to Zara's natural charm. She added Jimmy Choo heels, a silk tulle veil, and a bouquet by Mayfair florist Paul Thomas.<br></p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=8abbe3a0398b-zara-tindall-wedding>Zara’s heirloom tiara</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8abbe3a0398b-zara-tindall-wedding.jpg><p>She added a precious&nbsp;<a href=#>Greek tiara</a> known as&nbsp;<a href=#>Princess Andrew's Meander Tiara</a> that belonged to her mother, Princess Anne. It originated in Greece's royal family, with Prince Philip's mother Alice gifting the tiara to Queen Elizabeth II – and the Queen subsequently passed it on to her daughter, Princess Anne.</p><p>The 'something borrowed' piece consists of a brilliant-cut diamond surrounded by a glittering wreath.

Anne, who was previously married to Zara's father Captain Mark Phillips, eloped because the Church of Scotland permitted the remarriage of divorced persons, unlike the Church of England. &nbsp;</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=1736b9631786-charles-camilla-zara-wedding>Charles and Camilla</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1736b9631786-charles-camilla-zara-wedding.jpg><p>Zara's uncle King Charles and his wife Queen Camilla were also a part of the then-30-year-old's special day.
