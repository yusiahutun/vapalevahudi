He once told the world: “Perfection is just… boring. Perfect is what’s natural or real; that is beauty.” Now, we know Ethan Hawke feels the same, and admits it when it comes to his teeth and smile.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-1659534035-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ethan-hawke-s-decision-of-not-fixing-his-teeth>Ethan Hawke’s decision of not fixing his teeth</h2><p><a href=#>Celebrities</a> are often worshiped for being the epitome of perfection. Before Sunrise star Ethan Hawke choice to not fix his crooked teeth came as a rebellious act against a widely perceived notion.</p><p>The 53-year-old American rom-com heartthrob was ‘asked’ by his former agent to ‘fix’ his smile. But Ethan took offense over the remark on his crooked teeth. He looked back at an incident that made him determined to keep his gnashers perfectly the way they are.</p><p>He made up his mind that day, there and then.</p><p>The Reality Bites star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">offered</a>: “I watched the Oscars on TV a few years ago, and they all looked like they were pod people. They looked so fake. And then crazy&nbsp;Sean Penn&nbsp;got on stage, and I thought to myself, ‘There’s a human being.'”</p><p>“I just hate how homogenized people want us all to be. Nobody ever talks about Eleanor Roosevelt’s crooked teeth, because she was a woman of substance. And we don’t talk about how Mother Teresa would have been better if she could have lost 15 pounds, because she was a woman of God,” Ethan made his case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-105315255-720x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ethan-hawke-tried-hard-to-be-liked-and-hated-himself-for-it>Ethan Hawke tried hard to be liked and hated himself for it</h2><p>The Academy Award-nominated actor’s life has not been an easy journey. He once opened up about his childhood which became his first lesson in ‘acting’ and how he tried really hard to be liked by his own father.</p><p>Recalling his parents’ separation, the actor confessed his efforts to please his dad, who was a conservative man.</p><p>“I loved him so much, I wanted him to like me. I was aware that I was performing for him. I hated myself for it,” Ethan <a href=# rel=nofollow>added</a>.</p><p>In between shuttling between his parents and ‘acting’ to be someone they like, Ethan felt that he is losing himself. &nbsp;</p><p>“I can’t find myself,” he admitted to his mother, “I can’t find me.”</p><p>Talking about the incident, he also added: “As I grew older, I realized that both personalities were just aspects of myself. I became very aware of the ability to shape your personality and do it honestly.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WDcLnOr6CeZaOprrN5xK2fmqZdna64t8RmrqKknGK7psLEq2Sfoahitaq%2FjJypqKebmrFuwMSeq6FlkZvBpr6MsJitm5ieu6h5069m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./article-72dff9c8-f006-11ed-ad23-3b9ddc023d55-html.html><span>←</span><span>Carolyn Greco Wiatrolik | | leader-call.com</span></a>
