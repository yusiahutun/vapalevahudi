He can‚Äôt do it from his phone, it just doesn‚Äôt work from phones (cool neat). He needs a laptop to do it, and asked to borrow mine. Little bit of a weird request. I‚Äôm sure all of you are security conscious and that should be a yellow flag. But he was an old fella, nice guy, his friend was standing right there. We sat there together both looking at the screen while he did it.</p><p>He went to the internal (put public-facing) Delta website, logged in, and tried to use the voucher system, but it just loaded a blank white page with no errors at all, which he didn‚Äôt understand. I understood it: this thing is wicked broken. I turned off my content blocker thing, 90% of the time it‚Äôs that in my experience, no dice. We tried another browser, no dice. It was just broken. I couldn‚Äôt help.</p><p>These are just anecdotal, but I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall have endless stories and experiences too. Software that just absolutely doesn‚Äôt work. Tends to be websites.</p><p>One way to look at it is opportunity. If you make software that does work reliably, you‚Äôve got a leg up. Even if your customers don‚Äôt tell you ‚ÄúI like your software because it always works‚Äù, they‚Äôll feel it and make choices around knowing it.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=article-end>ü§ò</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpbGdgbXxxfY6oq6GdomK9prvPpZysZZKqwLWxw2aqqJ6krK6zsYyiqmaZnmK8sbzOq6uuppmpxnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katya-elise-henry-wiki-boyfriend-net-worth-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Katya Elise Henry Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
