But this was a Hollywood duo which was meant to be, and in 2021 the actors went public with their relationship.</p><p id=e8qylRGhIxxm data-wc=39>While both remain very private about their romance, now that it is out in the open the <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Euphoria</a></strong> and <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Chaos Walking</a></strong> stars appear to be settling into the benefits of <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>not trying to hide</a></strong> their love for each other.</p><h2><strong>When did Tom Holland and Zendaya meet?</strong></h2><p id=eykLUhYiJ81q data-wc=17>Tom Holland and Zendaya met in 2016 during Zendaya's audition for Marvel's first Spider-Man film, Spider-Man: Homecoming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/ab471860b836-gettyimages-697357472.jpg><p id=ezjTWkAlViqc data-wc=58>Zendaya revealed a cute disagreement between her and the talented <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>actor and gymnast</a></strong> about their first meeting in an interview with <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Variety</a></strong> in 2017. "He says when we first met it was super awkward because he went for a handshake and I went for a hug," she said. "But I don’t remember that. I thought it was cool."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/59bbf04e62e2-tom-zendaya-on-set-z.jpg><p id=eD2qb9YbA_Fi data-wc=50>The meeting quickly led to the two actors developing a close friendship. Shortly after spending more time with his costar on the set of Spider-Man: Homecoming, Tom told <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a></strong> magazine about how he and Zendaya had already become "like the best of friends" before adding: "She’s so great and amazing."</p><p id=ek8ln8GVeIFJ data-wc=61>But both of the Hollywood stars insisted it was just a friendship for now, despite the on-screen romance between their Spider-Man characters. "We are friends… he's a great dude. We're the best of friends," was Zendaya's response when Variety tried to explore if there was any truth to rumours that the two were dating during their interview with her in 2017.</p><h2><strong>When did Tom Holland and Zendaya start dating?</strong></h2><p id=eyv19-SJZf3n data-wc=59>It is unclear exactly when the Marvel duo started dating. Tom and Zendaya avoided and denied relationship rumours for quite some time before they became more open about their relationship in 2021. And while relationship rumours had been circling the young couple since 2017, it seems they genuinely were just close friends for a while after they first met.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/8b0f1ffaf2ac-gettyimages-696271572.jpg><p id=evp1J3atyawn data-wc=29>Social media posts which the two shared for each other's birthdays show there was a lot of friendly love shared between the pair before they decided to try dating.</p><p id=eMv3sGYvR_vp data-wc=44>Back in 2017, Tom posted on Instagram for Zendaya's 21st birthday, joking about their height difference by saying: "Thinking about how to get taller." He then added the more heartfelt message: "Happy birthday mate. Miss you and I'll have a drink for you. #21stbirthday".</p><p id=ee3N-5BITFgC data-wc=55>For the Uncharted actor's 23rd birthday in 2019, Zendaya shared a laid-back photo of herself, Tom, fellow Spider-Man: No Way Home star Jacob Batalon and her assistant Darnell Appling on Instagram with the caption: "Happy birthday weirdo, thanks for being the wonderful person you are, we’re all very lucky to have you and your weirdness."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4639119e459c-zendaya-tom-and-cast-z.jpg><p id=eIbT5zaGc0xo data-wc=29>Later that year, the Spider-Man actor revealed he was single in an interview with <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Elle</a></strong> magazine, but again denied rumors that he and his co-star were dating each other.</p><h2><strong>When did Tom and Zendaya's relationship go public?</strong></h2><p id=ew2J1XVaKzuS data-wc=35>The actors' relationship was eventually revealed to the public in 2021 after they were photographed by paparazzi kissing in a car. Of the incident, Tom told GQ: "We sort of felt <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>robbed of our privacy</a></strong>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/640ff8972903-tom-holland-zendaya-my-mj.jpg><p id=e3Ds94_OFuAv data-wc=51>After the photos were published, the A-listers continued to mostly keep private, but began being <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>more openly loving</a></strong> towards each other in social media posts. To celebrate the Euphoria star's 25th birthday in 2021, Tom posted a beautiful picture of the duo from their time filming one of the Spider-Man films.</p><p id=euTfFxThZRKN data-wc=74>With the photo, the actor added an adorable caption <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>full of love</a></strong>: "My MJ, have the happiest of birthdays. Gimme a call when your up xxx". Zendaya <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>returned the favour</a></strong> later that year, calling the actor "my Spider-Man" in an Instagram post celebrating the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home. During that film's press tour the couple were publicly affectionate, and since then, the two have been seen out and about on several dates.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/bf916d201c9e-gettyimages-1471656858.jpg><p id=eIB2vvsOOSV3 data-wc=34>Their amazingly romantic visit to the Louvre in October 2022 even went viral with fans comparing the Marvel pair's relationship to the works of art Tom and Zendaya were visiting the museum to admire.</p><h2 data-gid=evHDciRVDM>When did Tom Holland and Zendaya buy a home together?</h2><p id=eN76I2WbCsP data-wc=32>The young couple took their relationship to the next level in 2022 when they bought a $3 million home in London, just four miles away from where Tom grew up in Kingston-upon-Thames.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eXBBFCqponC data-wc=43>Tom and Zendaya flew from LA to collect the keys to their new place.

They are very much in love and wanted their first home to be in London where Tom grew up. Everyone is thrilled for them."</p><h2><strong>Are Tom Holland and Zendaya still together?</strong></h2><p id=eUQex41MGVl_ data-wc=51>Yes, Tom and Zendaya are still together. The Spider-Man couple have been together now for two years, and their romance is showing no signs of stopping. Since their relationship went public, the pair have both enjoyed sharing small tokens of love for each other in person and also via social media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/1c7794433d1e-gettyimages-1357361572.jpg><p id=eKtsKd_PsY data-wc=60>In mid-February 2022 the couple were spotted doing one of the most adorable couple activities – outfit twinning – at a New York Rangers vs Red Wings ice hockey game. To make matters even cuter, the stars were wearing each other's hockey jerseys; Tom was wearing a shirt with "Zendaya" on the back, meanwhile Zendaya had one which said "Holland".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/f69164989d44-tom-zendaya-red-carpet-z.jpg><p id=e2y931f7BR9C data-wc=58>A year later, after <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Zendaya wore four show-stopping looks</a></strong> in just under 24 hours as she attended both the SAG and NAACP Image awards in February 2023, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Tom commented several heart-eye emojis</a></strong> on one of her photos from the night. The Uncharted actor's small gesture led fans into a frenzy about how sweet the two Hollywood A-listers are.</p><p id=eRuJWQnDHtTx data-wc=53>In late March 2023, the couple were spotted several times out and about enjoying life in London. While their trips to the city's parks and to a grocery store were covered by paparazzi, the couple&nbsp;were happy for a Michelin star restaurant to capture their visit in some photos for its social media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/9dfef79da7c6-33770361412987764608492353813933081353451770n.jpg><p id=e07quzT6CrUg data-wc=45>Having <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>enjoyed a romantic dinner</a></strong> at Michelin-starred restaurant Jamavar, Tom and Zendaya were photographed with the restaurant's culinary director and executive chef, Surender Mohan. He later shared the photo on Instagram, writing: “Was a pleasure having @zendaya & @tomholland2013 dine with us @jamavarlondon this afternoon.”</p><p id=eKpvVktlAB5d data-wc=52>The photo showcased Zendaya and Tom's elegant attire for the evening. <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Style icon</a></strong> Zendaya looked stunning in a lavender dress, complemented by a tan coat, sheer black tights, and boots. Meanwhile Tom, a London native, dressed to impress in a rainbow-striped sweater, white collared top, brown slacks, and a brown-check blazer coat.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/0d2d5bf819e8-3389012951695147689173622928267203471412439n.jpg><p id=eEgHrxD3nAP9 data-wc=71>In Spring 2023, Tom and Zendaya visited Mumbai, India. Their visit involved attending the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre's gala on March 31, and then saw the pair turn the trip into a private couple's vacation. Evidence of this was found by fans when a photo of the couple was shared to Instagram by a yacht chartering service, Blue Bay Marine, as they enjoyed some time on one of their yachts.</p><p id=eiHwTNpTL4 data-wc=74>On April 8, 2023, the cute couple were spotted enjoying a date together in England at <a class=hm-link href=#>Hampton Court Palace</a>. Taking to Instagram after their visit, one of the palace's tour guides wrote that the couple were "just the most lovely and down to earth people" while sharing some photos which showed how the famous duo had been happy to pose for photos with members of staff as they enjoyed learning about the palace's history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/e76d8677cfbc-tom-zendaya-hampton-court-visit.jpg><p id=eHYBp--lSrwA data-wc=90>As of June 2023, the pair remain still very much in love. Fans got another chance to celebrate the Spiderman stars' special connection on June 1, when as per tradition, Zendaya posted another cute tribute to her beau on his birthday. After spending a day swimming and surfing, the Euphoria actress posted two photos of Tom to her Instagram stories. In the first, he could be seen making a heart symbol with his hands while swimming in the water, while in the second he was smiling happily on the shore.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/255d2d731c56-zendaya-tom-holland-birthday-2023-pics-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d7780d74fbb2-zendaya-tom-holland-birthday-2023-pics.jpg><p id=emODSQGFPD data-wc=63>In June 2023, while doing press interviews for his latest TV show <a class=hm-link href=#>The Crowded Room</a>, Tom admitted the role while enjoyable to get his teeth into had also been <a class=hm-link href=#>a difficult one to perform</a>. "The show did break me," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>ExtraTV</a>, before admitting: "There did come a time where I was sort of like, 'I need to have a break'."&nbsp;</p><p id=e52pFtqst1 data-wc=31>The young actor then revealed that since wrapping on the production, he has been enjoying a restful year away from acting, no doubt aided by the support of his girlfriend Zendaya.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Are Tom Holland and Zendaya getting engaged?</strong></h2><p id=e5BRtqJA9m71 data-wc=38>Neither Tom nor Zendaya appear ready to get engaged just yet.

But with that being said, following a manicure in March 2023, Zendaya did show off <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>a gold signet ring</a></strong> which had the initials "TH" engraved on it.</p><p id=e1XtzK2cRr_4 data-wc=44>Eagle eyed Zendaya fans and Tomdaya worshippers alike noticed that these are those of her boyfriend’s name; Tom Holland, and while the ring is not a sign of an engagement just yet, it is another great example of the couple's already super strong bond.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/83037975ece5-zendaya-nails.jpg><p id=e3tELGEa2Y3h data-wc=32>It's unclear whether the ring originally belonged to the Spider-Man star or if Zendaya had the bauble made in tribute to her beau, but safe to say both options are hugely romantic!</p><p id=exTtW3ghL1QF data-wc=57>Following her Emmy win for Euphoria in 2022, Zendaya gave another <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>adorable insight</a></strong> into the couple's new comfort talking about their relationship in public. When asked by <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>E!Online&nbsp;</a></strong>about who she first contacted to celebrate her win, Zendaya lovingly said: "I didn’t have to text my mom because my mom was already there… I texted my boyfriend."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/8c9b606820d8-zendaya-emmys-tom-holland.jpg><p id=eTi8e3NFFB5 data-wc=74>Speaking on Jay Shetty's podcast in July 2023, Tom gave a rare insight into his and Zendaya's views on<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>keeping their relationship out of the spotlight</a>. Calling their bond "most sacred," the actor said: "I try my best to keep it as private as possible...
