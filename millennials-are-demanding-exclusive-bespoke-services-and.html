People associate luxury with exclusivity, yes, but also now with individualism.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Travel like a rich millennial: 4 bespoke experiences in Asia</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Polls back this up. Research by Deloitte in 2017 found that 40.6 per cent of Chinese millennial consumers were ready to pay a premium to get a product in some way personalised to them, with 71.4 per cent of US millennial consumers saying the same – suggesting that bespoke still has plenty of room for growth regionally.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A bespoke service is one way brands can also take on other pressures facing the ready-made luxury goods market – the issue of authentication, the increased demand for transparency, and even the trend of renting rather than owning luxury goods.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A bespoke service also provides valuable customer insight – just what is it that customers want – that can offer feedback for a brand’s more “standard” products. Brands like Dior, for example, have long offered bespoke services.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/04/ca7cfcae-d8f8-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_972x_163833.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ettinger is not the only brand to have launched bespoke recently. Italian menswear company Brioni has extended its bespoke option to include denim – its jeans are now available personally tailored, with a choice of fabric, stitching, hardware and monogramming.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If getting a name for yourself as a specialist maker of swimming trunks is a challenge, Havelock Bay has given itself a boost with the launch of its bespoke service, while tailoring-oriented designer Joshua Kane shows his diversity by extending his bespoke service to include a leather biker jacket made to your specifications.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/04/5ad1554e-d858-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_972x_163833.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pink Shirtmaker has undergone a brand overhaul – the LVMH-owned British shirtmaker was formerly known as Thomas Pink – central to which has been the launch of a bespoke service out of its London workshop and new Beijing store (with two more stores in China to follow in the spring, including one in Shanghai). Unusually, Pink is offering a full pattern service with a huge range of fabrics – there are 71 shades of a white, with a recent client ordering in 50 of them – but without a minimum order and priced according to the fabrics selected.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1eav71q e1haapfp2">People associate luxury with exclusivity, yes, but also now with individualismRobert Ettinger</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Pink had got to a sorry situation over recent years and people would question if the company could really do proper shirt-making,” says Pink’s chief executive Christopher Zanardi-Landi.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Launching a bespoke service is a way of showing that we’re capable of the pinnacle of the shirtmaker’s art – and why, having decided to launch bespoke, we haven’t cut any corners. But we also wanted bespoke to be more attainable rather than the once-in-a-lifetime experience that it is for most people.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">How bespoke high jewellery is created for the super-rich</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Most bespoke has an ‘exclusive’ price tag attached but we wanted bespoke to feel like something you could enjoy fairly regularly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/04/85d8498e-d8fb-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_972x_163833.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">In the atelier: how Corthay’s bespoke shoes are made</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brands looking to find a new audience – or retain a newly demanding audience – through a bespoke offer is not limited to clothing. Last year, the Hilton hotel group launched a dedicated online platform to facilitate the creation of bespoke experiences for its guests. And furniture brand Heal’s introduced a bespoke service to counteract the “flat-pack, off-the-shelf culture”, as the company has put it.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Luxury car companies like Rolls-Royce have long offered bespoke programmes, but more prevalent now are external design agencies ready to put a spin on a car that perhaps takes it beyond the manufacturer’s comfort zone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For example, Swiss company R-Reforged has teamed up with Ian Callum – ex-head of design at Jaguar – to build specialist versions of Aston Martin’s Vanquish. Aston itself has launched a bespoke garage design service.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/04/b69d1882-d8fc-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433_972x_163833.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Technology is likely to bring more brands to finally dip a toe into, if not full bespoke, then at least the personalisation that is so in demand. Online shopping makes it easier and more affordable for luxury brands to do so – both for new start-ups such as Unmade knitwear, Son of a Tailor T-shirts and Hawthorne Lab fragrances, as well as established brands like Fendi – with 3D printing and robotics perhaps taking matters further still.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">These are the world’s 9 most valuable sneakers – do you own a pair?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Tech is going to be huge in bringing a much more personalised experience to a lot of the things we buy,” adds Zanardi-Landi.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“And that’s right for the times. There are more consumers who are more connoisseur-like. There’s a desire to have things that are beautiful and genuine and that allow people to express their individuality but which are also discreet. Bespoke brings all of that.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Want more stories like this?
