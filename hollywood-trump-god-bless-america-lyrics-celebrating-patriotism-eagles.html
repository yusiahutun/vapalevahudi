But through much of the song he bobbed his head along, and only opened his mouth for a word here or there. That was enough to get Twitter all riled up, convinced that the president doesn't know the words to this patriotic song performed at an event he hosted to spotlight his patriotism.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3345d437-9759-5ca6-89f7-1ec7bcd1f703 data-container-ref=toofab:article:c765a925-9d62-51b1-b299-f7263d1f94de data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b4/5by4/2018/06/05/b4cc4189b27b5e49a3f4b1c43d017a36_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'The View' Gets Fired Up Tackling Trump's Decision to Punt Philadelphia Eagles From White House</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The president rescinded the invitation to the Eagles after learning that "only a small number" of them would be coming.Trump has been an outspoken opponent of players kneeling for the national anthem, and even came out against the NFL's recent ban of the act, because it allowed players to stay in the locker room as a form of protest.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!</p><a href=# rel=noopener>@realDonaldTrump</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!</p><a href=# rel=noopener>@realDonaldTrump</a><p>The bottom line is that Trump tried to save face over a situation that would have made him look bad if fewer than 10 Eagles showed up, as some outlets are reporting. Unfortunately for his ego, though, appearing to botch a patriotic song at his replacement patriotic event (deemed a "Celebration of America") seems to have had the opposite result as Twitter lit up.</p><p>"The Late Show," "The Daily Show" and Bad Lip Reading all tried to figure out what Trump was singing by redubbing the video to hilarious results, while the rest of Hollywood had a field day tearing the whole debacle apart.
