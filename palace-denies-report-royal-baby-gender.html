An article in claimed that the Duchess had told friends that she planned to raise her child in a gender-neutral way, with sources stating that Meghan had used the word 'fluid' to describe her plans. The magazine piece notes that there are "multiple possible interpretations" behind the claims. A palace spokesman said on Saturday: "This story is totally false."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a21087feb52b-meghan-markle-harry-at-stables-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eeUJLPaa2ipV data-wc=12><strong>The palace have denied recent reports about Meghan and Harry's parenting plans</strong></p><p id=eor5Yi5qw9Gw data-wc=67>The royal couple are set to welcome their first baby in the coming months, with speculation swirling as to whether they will have a boy or a girl. Fans were convinced it will be a little girl following Meghan's New York baby shower, for which some of the sweet treats and decorations were pink, though there were in fact a range of neutral colours at the affair.</p><p id=egmETAa0kjt3><a class=hm-link href=#>Meghan Markle's horoscopes for March ahead of the royal baby</a></p><p id=e-im117agHGA data-wc=53>It's unknown when Meghan will officially take her maternity leave, though she shows no sign of slowing down as yet, continuing to attend official engagements and overseas visits. Harry and Meghan are expected to make the <a class=hm-link href=#>move to Windsor imminently</a>, as they relocate from Kensington Palace to Frogmore Cottage to settle into their new family home.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=e1w3zMaRcf8N data-wc=69>The renovation work has been tipped to cost some £3million – with the building work covered by the Sovereign Grant, while Harry and Meghan will foot the bill for the interiors. It's been reported that the home will include a private yoga studio, an eco-friendly nursery and luxurious décor by Vicky Charles, Soho House's top interior designer. No doubt the couple are looking forward to making it their own. &nbsp;</p><p id=eg-Hv6SkKM7j><a class=hm-link href=#>William, Kate, Meghan and Harry pay tribute following sad palace news</a></p><p id=ecDpFUOvUq6_ data-wc=32>Harry and Prince William <a class=hm-link href=#>are thought to be splitting their royal households</a> within weeks, too. A natural move since both have families of their own and increasingly different responsibilities, the change will see them separate courts and divide their staff.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
