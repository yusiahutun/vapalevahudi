MoviesObituaryMichael Sarrazin obituaryCanadian actor who had a decade of Hollywood success playing anti-heroesThe Canadian-born actor Michael Sarrazin, who has died of cancer aged 70, was so visible in Hollywood movies from 1967 to 1977 that one may wonder what happened to his subsequent career. A facetious answer might be that he moved back to Canada and made Canadian movies. Another answer might be that his sensitive, gently rebellious, flower-child persona and his lanky, boyish looks, with his long hair and soulful eyes, were no longer appropriate to the roles he took as he got older.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mike Tyson was knocking out grown men at just 12 years old, says former trainer Teddy Atlas</h2><time>Feb 24, 2024</time>

Mike Tyson held the unofficial title of “Baddest Man on the Planet” in his luminous heyday, but did you know he was knocking out grown men in sparring when he was just 12 years old?
Teddy Atlas, the former trainer of “Iron Mike”, revealed something some boxing aficionados might not have known: one of the world’s most feared heavyweights in history showed raw power even before hitting his teens.

All eyes seem to be on Taylor Swift these days, whether for her sold-out Eras tour or her high profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce. But what we're focused on is her lips - her signature bold red lipstick that she has worn in music videos, on stage and even as she joins Kansas City Chiefs tight-end Travis on date nights out.
Taylor’s bold red lip was a winner as she cheered Travis and the Chiefs to victory against the New York Jets, and again when she stepped out with her new boyfriend for an SNL after party.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The good, bad and ugly sides of Cape Town worlds No 2 destination in Lonely Planets Best i</h2><time>Feb 24, 2024</time>

THE GOOD
From winter sunbathing to wine tasting, whale watching to paddling with penguins, Cape Town offers a unique introduction to the African continent. Regular appearances in “world’s best city” polls, including second spot in prestigious travel publisher Lonely Planet’s 2017 ranking, emphasise Cape Town’s bucket-list credentials. If it’s sightseeing you’re after, you’ve come to the right place.
Table Mountain is unmissable – and hard to miss. The 3km-wide granite and sandstone plateau seems to follow you around the city, especially in the afternoon, when a sheet of cloud known as the tablecloth rolls over the flat-topped rock like a waterfall.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Who is Bridget Hardy dating?
