The Oscars may be the most prestigious of awards shows, but that doesn’t mean the hairstyles need to be stiff. Some of the most gorgeous looks happen to be the ones that look just a touch undone, almost as if the actress could’ve done it herself at home (keyword almost). In honor of the Oscars this week, we decided to take a look back at some of our favorite looks from the past and couldn’t stop ogling at Amy Adams’ undone chignon from the 2013 red carpet.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Sarah Hassan wedding photos, dress, video &amp;amp; story</h2><time>Feb 26, 2024</time>

The psychology behind Necrophilia
This article might be disturbing for some individuals
The term Necrophilia has been derived from the Greek words “nekro” which means dead body and the word “philios’ ‘ which means love and attraction.
