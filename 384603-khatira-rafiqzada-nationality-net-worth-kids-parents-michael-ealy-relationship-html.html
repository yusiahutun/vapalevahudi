Despite the odds, she managed to complete her studies and became a teacher.</p><p class=align-left>Later she went on to become a political journalist on public radio. Around this time, she learnt of the possibility of war in Afghanistan. It was then that she decided to move to America with her family. It is not clear where both Khatira Rafiqzada parents moved or whether it was just her mother and the kids.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Lorie Campbell and Paul Campbell relationship, family, children</p><p class=align-left>Khatira says that her mother fought for her right to get a college education in America.

Before that, she was an Afghan immigrant who came to the United States courtesy of a Catholic charity. Because of the experience she went through as an immigrant, Khatira has been vocal in fighting for immigrants, also known as dreamers.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>When it comes to the beginning of her career, not much information is available about Khatira. In an Instagram post, she says that she served food, took care of kids, and cleaned homes. It is not clear whether this was before or after her graduation.</p><p class=align-left>In 2009, Khatira made her debut in acting landing a role in the short film <i>Layla</i>. The film tells the story of a dictating Afghan father and his meek daughter, who are in the world of drug smuggling. In the show, Khatira portrayed the character of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Zola</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5fd87c47c2b22363.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mungai Eve's biography: boyfriend, YouTube earnings, education, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Joan Lin, Jackie Chan's wife, bio, age, and children</p><p class=align-left>In 2010, Khatira landed another role, this time in a horror film – <i>Chain Letter</i>. The film follows six friends who are stalked by a murderer who uses chains to kill.</p><p class=align-left>In <i>Chain Letter</i>, Khatira portrayed the role of Miss Garrett, a guidance counsellor. The film was her most significant role in Hollywood, as she appeared alongside top actors and actresses such as Nikki Reed, Keith David, Betsy Russel, Brad Dourif, and others.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, <i>Chain Letter</i> would be the last of Khatira Rafiqzada movies. Following its release, she did not take any more acting gigs. Instead, she chose to move away from Hollywood for other pursuits.</p><h2>Khatira Rafiqzada husband, dating, and marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpg><p class=align-left>Khatira Rafiqzada and Michael Ealy first met in 2008, before Khatira's acting career started. While on Kelly Clarkson's show, Ealy recounted their <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hilarious first date</a> where she dictated the day and time they would go out.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7c8f0f39d42f9399.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Melissa Womer: children, Jim Carrey, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Khatira also made another bold move, where she asked for them to get the first kiss out of the way. According to Ealy, she would not want to see him again if the kiss was terrible. Given that they are still together more than 12 years later; we are left to assume that he is a good kisser.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Kenan Thompson's wife, Christina Evangeline, biography and facts</p><p class=align-left>Soon after the couple started dating, Khatira landed her first acting roles. However, her career was short-lived, lasting only one year. Since then, everything about her life has been private. Many people assumed that this was due to Michael Ealy's nature of being reserved.</p><p class=align-left>However, during an interview on the Wendy Williams Show, Ealy said up that it was her decision. Admittedly, she wanted to focus on her family life.</p><p class=align-left>He also opened up on how Khatira has been supportive of his career – including not being jealous of fans, something Hollywood couples have difficulty navigating. She also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">makes jokes</a> with Ealy – and even his co-stars – about his sex scenes; another relationship issue that can bothersome for celebrity couples.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/79906f3403a94856.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cynthia Morgan biography: boyfriend, sickness, net worth, what happened, latest pictures</span></p></a><h2>Khatira and Michael Ealy's children</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/122d0fef0119b02d.jpg><p class=align-left>Soon after getting married, Khatira Rafiqzada gave birth to a son, Elijah Brown. She welcomed him into the world sometime around April 2014. Not surprising, like everything else in the couple's life, Michael Ealy decided to keep the details of Elijah Brown and Khatira Rafiqzada private. It was not some months later that the public found out the couple had a son.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Speaking to Steve Harvey</a> in an Interview, Ealy admitted that he is not the kind of person who shares such private and personal things with just about everyone. According to him, his son was a blessing to him and his wife, and keeping quiet about it was the best way to treasure that. He enjoyed fatherhood without drama for the few months that people did not know about Elijah.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> A biography or Kurt Russell's wife, Goldie Hawn</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ea79e8cad29e3fc2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lukwesa Burak parents, husband, family, salary, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Aside from Elijah, the couple has another child, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Harlem</a>, who was born on September 21, 2016. Again, the couple decided to keep the occasion private, with the only hint being a photo that appeared on Michael Ealy's and Khatira Rafiqzada Instagram account.</p><p class=align-left>However, despite his desire to keep details of his family private, Ealy has been very vocal about the love he has for them. He loves spending time with his son lazing around on Saturdays while watching cartoons in their pyjamas.</p><p class=align-left>In an interview <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">with Steve Harvey</a>, he also talked of how his daughter is his whole new love, even though he thought - at one time – that he couldn't love another child as much as his son.</p><p class=align-left>Khatira and the couple's children also like to spend some time on Ealy's set. In a Kelly Clarkson interview, he recounted a hilarious and adorable moment where his daughter defended him following a scene with a co-star.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/abd282917c4f0d52.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Julie Gichuru bio: Husband, children, parents, house, facts</span></p></a><h2>Khatira Rafiqzada net worth and earnings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5fd87c47c2b22363.jpg><p class=align-left>After choosing to retire from acting and shying away from the public limelight, Khatira has been a stay-at-home mom. Therefore, the sole breadwinner in the family is Michael Ealy, who sustains them with his acting salary.</p><p class=align-left>Currently, Michael Ealy is starring in the TV show, <i>Stumptown</i>, a successful premise where his co-star reportedly pockets around <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$200,000 - $250,000</a> per episode. And while his salary in the Stumptown is not publicly known, you can expect that he takes quite a substantial amount home every month.</p><p class=align-left>When it comes to Khatira Rafiqzada's net worth, her wealth is tied to her husband. Michael Ealy has been quite successful, appearing in high-grossing franchises such as <i>2 Fast 2 Furious</i>, <i>Think Like a Man</i>, <i>The Perfect Guy</i>, <i>Almost Human</i>, and more. As a result, his net worth (and consequently that of his wife) is around $3 million.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dcda79253699b76f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Joya Tillem: the untold story of Jon Favreau's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Charles Michael Davis relationship status and biography</p><p class=align-left>Noteworthy, Michael Ealy has enjoyed several successful ventures in recent years, which have undoubtedly pushed the couple's net worth up. His appearance in ABC's <i>Stumptown</i> is a good example.</p><p class=align-left>Other successful roles he has enjoyed recently include films such as The Intruder, Jacob's Ladder, and yet to be released Fatale. He also guest-starred on HBO's hit show, West World.</p><p class=align-left>A popular saying goes that behind every successful man, there is a strong woman. When it comes to Michael Ealy, a top Hollywood star, that woman is Khatira Rafiqzada. She abandoned her chance of becoming a successful Hollywood actress to concentrate on her family. Since then, she has been a loving mother, supportive wife, and a driving force behind one of the most successful Hollywood families.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke has compiled a list of the top 30 most handsome black men in the world.
