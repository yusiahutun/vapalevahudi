After dating for a few years, Rajon popped the big question. Below you’ll learn more about her age, career, family, baby father, and more.</p><p>So keep scrolling down this article to learn more about Latoia Fitzgerald.</p><h3><strong>Meet Latoia Fitzgerald, Rajon Rondo Partner</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Rajon Rondo was getting married to his now-fiancee Latoia Fitzgerald. He reportedly proposed to his longtime sweetheart on 8 September 2022. On Thursday night, the four-time All-Star got down on one knee and proposed to his then-girlfriend Latoia Fitzgerald. Additionally, she was throwing a sizable NYFW event for her clothing line, “Lionne,” making it one of the biggest nights of her life in more than one way.</p><p>TMZ reported that right as the show ended, Rondo hopped up on the runway as Latoia’s back was turned … and when she turned around and saw him, he found his opportunity to propose.</p><p>In a video obtained by&nbsp;The Shade Room,&nbsp;Latoia crouches down in front of Rajon and kisses him as she says yes. Latoia then stands up as Rajon puts the rock on her finger.</p><p>Rajon Rondo’s move seemed to be a real shocker to Latoia and the guests, who crowded around the couple and cheered as she accepted. The NBA star wasn’t the only household name in the building, either … Draya Michele, Fivio Foreign, and Flo Milli were among other celebs in attendance.</p><p>Latoia and Rajon started turning heads in early 2020. Rajon started showing her off on his socials. In December 2020, the NBA star and his girlfriend had a fight with a woman named Toktam Jorshari and the woman was suing them. The woman accused her of assaulting her over a parking space issue.</p><p>At the time, Republic World reported that Rajon didn’t reveal who his girlfriend was. According to Toktam’s lawsuit, Rajon and Latoia were involved in the violent altercation back in July 2020. The reports mentioned a parking lot, where Rondo’s $300,000 worth Rolls Royce SUV was parked in the handicapped spot. Rondo was apparently unhappy that Jorshari’s vehicle was parked close to his luxury car, which turned into an argument where the girlfriend attacked Jorshari.</p><p>The fight is clearly visible in the video that TMZ Sports shared. The woman is seen punching Jorshari after Rondo prods her with his arm, but there is no audio to be heard. The attorneys continued, noting that such behavior is “assault and battery” elsewhere. “In the NBA, unnecessary and excessive contact is considered a Flagrant 2 foul, which can result in a fine, ejection, and possible suspension of a player.”</p><p>Jorshari claimed that she wanted $1 million for damages – emotional distress coupled with assault and battery.</p><p>When images from the pair’s Maldives vacation went viral in October, Rajon Rondo talked openly about his connection with Fitzgerald. The images showed how much fun the 34-year-old was having after winning the NBA bubble. Latoia Fitzgerald, Rondo’s girlfriend, posted the images on Instagram, where they spread fast over social media.</p><p>Latoia also poured love on her beau, by giving a touching shoutout to him on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> following the Lakers winning the title on October 12, “Congratulations babe! Two rings with two of the biggest franchises in the NBA! A Gem! A leader! A true boss! #Lakers.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Latoia Fitzgerald Baby Father?</strong></h3><p>Latoia Fitzgerald is a mother of one child named Dillonger.

She is the founder of <a href=#>Lionne Clothing</a>, a Black female-owned business. She launched the fashion brand in 2018 and her brand has been an emerging luxury fashion house. Speaking to <a href=#>Essence</a>, she shared how her love for fashion sprouted.</p><p>Latoia said, “I’ve always loved fashion. I was raised in a creative household. My mom made clothing and home decor for everyone in the neighborhood. I remember trips to the fabric store and arts and crafts store as a child.”</p><p>She added, “I fell in love with making clothes when I was 12. The first thing I learned how to make was a pair of pants. As a teenager, I took hours to get ready because I played dress-up every time I got dressed.”</p><p>By the age of 10, this Philadelphia-bred designer was sewing and creating her own garments. She found early success in making clothes for friends while still in high school, inspiring her to enroll at the Art Institute of Philadelphia for Fashion Design. In 2010, she launched a contemporary brand with a friend, Michelle Savage, called LaToia Michelle. Today, she’s focused on Lionne, which debuted in 2019, and Dillonger, which hit the market in 2014.</p><p>But, passion wasn’t enough as she had to deal with challenges that came after running a business. Being creative, she had trouble with the business side of it.</p><p>Latoia also founded Dillonger Clothing, a children’s brand named after the designer’s son Dillon.</p><p>Latoia Fitzgerald impressed the crowd with a silky white halter-top gown during the premiere fashion show in Los Angeles on August 15, 2021, which was attended by celebrities including Jhené Aiko, Karrueche Tran, and La La Anthony. The gown may be worn for a beachfront elopement or as a weekend brunch dress.</p><p>Lionne’s target consumer is someone who doesn’t shy away from either option. “She’s a girl that likes to be sexy, but she’s also very classy, mysterious, and has an edge to her,” she says. “So I love a high slit, a low back.”</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Latoia Fitzgerald?</strong></h3><p>In 2022, Latoia Fitzgerald turned 36 years old.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Latoia Fitzgerald Parents?</strong></h3><p>As of this writing, Latoia Fitzgerland has previously shared in an interview that her mother worked as a seamstress and her father was a videographer.
