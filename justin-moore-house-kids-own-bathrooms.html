The family will celebrate&nbsp;their second year in their newly-built Arkansas home this Christmas season, but Moore&nbsp;admits that&nbsp;they still have changes they would like to make to improve their dream home.</p><p>"I don’t think its ever 100 percent finished, because we have stuff that we want to do or change or whatever,"&nbsp;he says.&nbsp;"It’s bigger than I wanted it to be. You can build a lot cheaper in Arkansas than you can in Nashville."</p><p><strong>Love Justin Moore?

Kate&nbsp;also&nbsp;recently opened a local children's clothing store called This Little Piggy.</p><p>“She's had this idea for a couple of years, and it just came to fruition," Moore explains. "We are obviously well versed in the clothing and all that, for having four kids."</p><p>Moore recently released&nbsp;a thought-provoking new single in "<a href=#>The Ones That Didn’t Make It Back Home</a>"&nbsp;and plans&nbsp;release a new album early next year. He'll also&nbsp;hit the road on a tour in support of new music.</p><p><strong>Listen to Justin Moore's Interview With ToC Nights,</strong></p><p><strong>Justin Moore Is a Country Music Superdad, And He's in Good Company:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo62jqbavecyopqudXZ28tr%2FEZqKinKNivLi6jJuYraCipLyuv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-giddey.html><span>←</span><span>Josh Giddey Biography, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
