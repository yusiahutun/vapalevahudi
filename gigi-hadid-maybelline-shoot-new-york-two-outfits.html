The suit was paired with a cropped white button-up, black leather pointed-toe shoes, and a thin black leather belt with gold oval hardware.</p><img alt="new york, new york march 26 gigi hadid is seen during a photo shoot for maybelline in soho on march 26, 2024 in new york city photo by gothamgc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - March 26, 2024" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2115640806-66042c85e13ec.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gotham</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="new york, new york march 26 gigi hadid is seen during a photo shoot for maybelline in soho on march 26, 2024 in new york city photo by gothamgc images" title="Celebrity Sightings In New York City - March 26, 2024" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-2115102293-66042ca8b0d7d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gotham</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hadid was later seen dressed in a more feminine gray suit, featuring a cropped button bustier and pleated wide-leg pants.

It’s about being able to look at the camera, and then, kind of in your out-of-focus vision, is the shape of you. It’s training a model to understand how she fits into the photo, which is why I became a model. Obviously, I’m not saying this as anything disrespectful against women, but you have to look at yourself like an object or a fashion object or a sculpture.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
