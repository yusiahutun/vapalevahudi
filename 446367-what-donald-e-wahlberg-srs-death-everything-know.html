I would work with him when he drove his truck and delivered it to all the schools. You know, both my parents worked very hard to put food on the table, so we didn't get the kind of time that I would have liked with him, especially when they got divorced. I remember thinking it was all about me and, you know, wanting them to be together. But it was obvious they were better apart than together. I remember sitting with him in the kitchen while he was listening to Al Jolson, having a Schlitz, smoking his Winstons, flicking the ash—you know, he'd be in the backyard or the garden, and he'd flick the ash into the cuff of his pants; he didn't want to flick the ash in his backyard. It was the first and only house he ever owned. And he bought it after winning a bet with a bookie.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4c6439ba1a3c3308.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>David Wolkoff biography: How rich is Stephanie Winston Wolkoff's husband?</span></p></a><h2>Donald E Wahlberg Sr wife</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/05e2f1455da512e0.png><p class=align-left>Who was Donald's wife?
