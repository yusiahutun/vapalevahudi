His lawyer, Larry Friedman, tells <a href=#>TMZ</a> that the troubled singer has "eliminated alcohol from his daily life."<span id=more-139787></span></p><p>The 53-year-old singer of such classics as 'Forever and Ever, Amen' and 'On the Other Hand' has a decades-long history of problems with substance abuse which goes all the way back to his twenties, when he was arrested for burglary and car theft.</p><p>"I got into the drug thing, I totaled two motorcycles, and I got in at least 30 fights," Travis revealed in an <a href=# rel=nofollow>interview with 'The 700 Club</a>.' He credited his now ex-wife and manager, Elizabeth Hatcher, for helping to set him straight. "Having her in court the last time, saying that I was not drinking, not using drugs, not running with the same people anymore -- that kept me from going to prison."</p><p>Travis married Hatcher in 1991, but the couple divorced in 2010 amid <a href=# rel=nofollow>tabloid reports</a> that Travis was having an affair and had resumed drinking. In June of 2011, the singer reportedly showed up drunk to a taping of 'Fox & Friends.'</p><p>"He turned up, looking like he'd been up all night, for a soundcheck around 5AM, then punched a wall in the green room and makeup area," a source told the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Post</a>. "He was supposed to tape an acoustic performance for 'Good Day New York,' but he was so out of it he couldn't do it, and they had to stop taping."</p><p>Travis was <a href=#>arrested for public intoxication</a> in February of 2012 and for <a href=#>suspicion of DWI</a> in August. The second time, he was reportedly naked and threatened the lives of the arresting officers. The singer was also <a href=#>cited for assault</a> in August after an altercation in a church parking lot, though sources later said he was not under the influence at the time.</p><p>Friedman says Travis is serious about getting alcohol out of his life and getting his priorities straight. “[Randy] works out three hours every day and is in the best shape of his life,” the lawyer reports. “He has a high protein diet and takes a lot of vitamins.”</p><p>Friedman added that Travis went into the studio in Texas last week to start laying down tracks for an upcoming recording project.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmq5memcZuwNGaraKrXZy2t7HSZqypZZGhsLC0zqVm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-markle-childrens-hospital-la-visit-sheer-top-floral-skirt.html><span>←</span><span>Meghan Markle Embodies Spring in a Sheer Top and Floral Skirt</span></a>
