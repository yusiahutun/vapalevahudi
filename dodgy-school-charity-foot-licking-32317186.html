If the students didn't carry out the dares then they were allegedly forced to pay $100 (£77) into the pot - something which some <a data-content-type=section-topic data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>students</a> simply couldn't afford.</p><p>One student told Fox News how it worked, as they said: "Any student could bid on another student. So say a student didn’t like me, they could put $100 on me to have to lick ketchup off of someone’s face.</p><p>"If I didn’t have $100 to give to the philanthropy to get out of it, I would just have to be involved with it. It honestly felt more like hazing in a way, because if you didn’t have money to get out of it, you were being forced to do it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32316571.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_police-main.jpg><p>The foot-licking wasn't the only disturbing task that students were made to do. One student told of how they were nominated to stand in a rubbish bin and have leftover food poured on to them until they threw up.</p><p>There was also 'bird-feeding', which a student described, as they said: "So the first student would have to drink something, put it in their mouth and then spit it into the next person’s mouth, and then spit it into the 3rd person’s mouth, and the 4th person had to swallow it."</p><p>Former pupils have since spoken out about how the charity event made them feel with one saying that they were riddled with anxiety and 'almost in tears'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32315462><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="'Travelodge Monster Mansion' owners vow to build another one after it was torn down" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32315462><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32317476.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Woman-biting-partners-toes-close-up.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32315271.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Dads-fight-to-save-illegal-£300k-Monster-Mansion-home-from-bulldozers-that-looks-like-Travelodge.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=32315462>'Travelodge Monster Mansion' owners vow to build another one after it was torn down</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p>A former Deer Creek student added: "It is bullying and harassment for minors because we didn't agree to any of this. There was no consent. The parents didn't know, there was no approval."</p><p>Deer Creek responded to the claims, as they said: "Based on the timeline of the statements provided to Deer Creek Schools for this story, these events allegedly took place between 2015-2019.</p><p>"As this was more than five years ago, it is difficult to confirm any specific situations that may have occurred and whether or not they were reported as we now have different leadership and policies in place. We can confirm that none of the events in question have taken place since 2020."</p><p><b><i>For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletter by clicking </i></b><a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>.</i></b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKaVrMBww8SiqZ1lnprEtHvDqJugsV2osKm7zqVknKCRp7a1xYyfpqisXaG2pLfIp55ma2Jofnh9l28%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hanger-tattoo-abortion-meaning.html><span>←</span><span>What a Coat Hanger Tattoo Means, According To Women Who Have It</span></a>
