As the 33-year-old actor explained, 1-year-old Hemmingway couldn't be more excited to be a big brother. "Hemingway has been preparing for the big day for quite some time," he said. "We bought him a little toy doll to take care of and he's been showing every sign that he's gonna be the best big brother."</p><p>The actor also explained that Gatsby's name wasn't actually inspired by the classic novel, The Great Gatsby, as one might suspect.&nbsp;"It was a wonderful series of coincidences that, all combined, led us to the name Gatsby.&nbsp;Last summer we took a trip to Paris. After a long flight with our one-year-old, Nila and the baby were wiped and decided to stay in that night so they could get settled into our hotel room. I ventured out into the warm rainy night, wandering the cobblestone streets to explore. Led by my curiosity and unyielding appetite for chocolate croissants, I stumbled upon a restaurant with the name 'Gatsby' printed across its blue yawning."</p><p>He continued,&nbsp;"It was all lit up and I found myself strangely drawn to it. There was something mystical about it so I snapped a picture. A few days later my wife was out on a walk of her own and came across the same yawning and took the exact same photo."</p><p>In addition to making the <a href=#>baby announcement</a> via ET, Hollingsworth&nbsp;introduced his new little bundle of joy to the world on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>.&nbsp;"'I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again...' World meet Gatsby Willem Hollingsworth," he wrote, captioning a sweet snapshot of himself with his two sons. "Who knew that my heart could double in one day. I'm one lucky üçÄGuy!"</p><p>Congratulations to the happy couple!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamljboJ4e8GepaOZnZ67brTOpaOippeoxLC%2B06FksKGWmnqvtcuaZLCdnJi8rrGMm5ibsV1nfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./madonna-proudly-attends-son-rocco-ritchies-art-opening-with-rare-appearance-of-daughters-mercy-stella-and-estere.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Madonna proudly attends son Rocco Ritchie's art opening with rare appearance of daughters Mercy, Ste</span></a>
