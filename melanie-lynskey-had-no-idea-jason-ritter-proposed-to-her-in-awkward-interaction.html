I don’t think I’m going to get it.'”</p><p>Ritter then kindly gifted her the ring to which the star responded: ‘Oh thanks!’ “It didn’t sort of cross my mind,” she explained. “And then there was this strange speech,” which happened while they were watching The Bachelor.</p><p>“I was just sort of like, ‘Oh, okay.’ And I was like, ‘We’re not breaking up?’ He was like, ‘No, No, No!’ So I said, ‘Okay,’ and then I was like, ‘Well, thank you … lovely, good chat!'”</p><p>It only gets worse from there. Days later, they went to meet Ritter’s family for Christmas, where he announced the big news. And it looked like he was announcing the news to his new fiancé too. “Are we?!” she exclaimed.</p><p>“But it was so confusing, and then I said, ‘That’s not usually what a proposal is like. People usually understand that it’s happening,'” she said.</p><p>However, it looks like the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star has been “very cute” ever since, proposing to Lynskey over and over.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-tied-the-knot-in-2020-but-they-didn-t-need-to>The couple tied the knot in 2020 – but they didn’t need to</h2><p>Despite getting engaged “over and over again” the couple actually tied the knot in 2020, before Melanie was leaving to go work on Yellowjackets in Canada.</p><p>“Honestly, I got married because someone was like, ‘Jason won’t get into Canada unless you’re married,’ which just wasn’t true,” she revealed on an interview with Sirius XM.</p><p>“I was like, ‘We have a child. What? I can’t leave for six months.’ So, I was like, ‘We have to get married tomorrow.'”</p><p>They then tied the knot in a small ceremony at their home in Atlanta, which the mom of one described as a “fun wedding day” although “it didn’t need to happen,” revealing they were originally going to wait until after the pandemic.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2h9cLnEpZinoZViubq60qScsmWYlrFuus5moJ2dkWK3or%2FOp2SroaSpsrN5z6umqaejmrFuwM5mn56qXZ67bq3WpK6aqpRitq%2FAxKuYnKyZpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./layered-yogurt-flatbreads.html><span>←</span><span>layered yogurt flatbreads</span></a>
