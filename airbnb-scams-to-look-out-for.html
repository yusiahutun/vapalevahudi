Its&nbsp;rules are filled with loopholes that scammers have wriggled their way into.</p><p>Things have gotten so bad that the internet is now filled with horror stories from vacationers who had a bad experience on the platform.</p><p>Here are some of the most common Airbnb scams you should know about before booking somewhere for your next vacation, and tips for protecting yourself.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=bait-and-switch-airbnb-scam>Bait and Switch Airbnb Scam</h2><p>The most common scammers you might encounter on Airbnb are those that will lure you into booking a nice-looking apartment.</p><p>You might think you got a great deal in the best part of the city at a really cheap price. But, on&nbsp;the day of your visit, you’ll receive a message from the host saying the accommodation you booked has a problem. The most common excuse is a plumbing issue.</p><p>They might&nbsp;also come up with another excuse to say the place&nbsp;is currently uninhabitable. This gets them off the hook and will save them from cancellation fees, since Airbnb doesn’t charge hosts a cancellation fee if this is the case.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The host might&nbsp;tell you that you can instead stay at another supposedly better accommodation, offered at the same price. But the new place&nbsp;is nothing like your original booking. It could be smaller and dingier, in an&nbsp;obscure part of the city.</p><p>Because you are thousands of miles away from home, don't know anyone in the area,&nbsp; and are desperate to find a place to stay, you take the offer.</p><p>Some scammers use this plumbing technique to force guests to book an alternative place that’s a lot more expensive. And because you won’t find anything else in the area last-minute, you'll feel forced to take it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=non-existent-apartments>Non-Existent Apartments</h2><p>Airbnb is has a lot of&nbsp;fake profiles, fake reviews, and fake accommodation listings. Some scammers will steal photos from other legitimate accommodations and offer them as their own.</p><p>Some scammers also operate within a group with other members who will make tons of fake user profiles, and leave fake reviews.</p><p>Scammers would sometimes lure guests into communicating off platform by giving their email addresses. They could communicate in-app the first few times but once you’re hooked they’ll start communicating with you via email. Payments will be completed&nbsp;off-platform, and some fall for this because they think they got a great deal and they don’t want to risk losing it.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>After sending the money, the scammer will run off and block you. They will deactivate the profile, and come back to&nbsp;create a different one. You won’t have a way to get a refund because the payment was done outside the platform.</p><h2 id=double-booking-guests>Double-Booking Guests</h2><p>Some report getting dumped by a host last minute because of, again, a plumbing issue or something similar. Then, the dumped guests will find out that someone else got the accommodation.</p><p>What these scammers do is offer the place on two different platforms, at different prices. One will be significantly lower and the other more expensive. If you book in advance and get it at a lower price, but someone else then books the higher price, the host will ditch you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Airbnb Nightmares and the Lessons You Can Learn From Them</a></span></p><p>There are also reports of guests arriving at a place they thought they would&nbsp;have to themselves. They’ll discover that other guests are already there occupying some rooms. Though&nbsp;it may have been an honest error when&nbsp;booking, it’s still a huge hassle and disappointment for the guest.</p><h2 id=how-do-you-protect-yourself-from-these-scams>How Do You Protect Yourself From These Scams?</h2><p>You can do a <a href=#>quick reverse image search</a> to check if profiles are genuine using mobile apps. With these, you can check the host's profile picture and photos of your place. You can also verify profiles of reviewers.</p><p>Watch out for hosts that lure you into communicating off-app. They might superimpose an email address on the photos, or sneak their contact information into the description.</p><p>Always communicate and pay only on Airbnb, so at least you’ll have a way to get your money back if something goes wrong.</p><p>Also, make sure you read Airbnb’s policies and rules so you know how to protect yourself. Read all the charges they’ll be making, and how to handle a dispute in case something comes up.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=airbnb-has-lots-of-room-for-improvement>Airbnb Has Lots of Room for Improvement</h2><p><a href=#>Airbnb</a> is&nbsp;a nifty platform that has revolutionized how people travel. But&nbsp;it’s still relatively new, so there are still many loopholes that need to be plugged. It's important to know when you might be getting scammed so you don't become a victim.</p><p>Reading policies and checking the host’s profile might take time but that’s nothing compared to the stress you’ll encounter if a scammer runs off with your money or you end up in a dark and dingy apartment in the middle of nowhere.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiYoqqSo69uv8KapKxlpKR6rbvOpGSoraRis7C%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ap-wall-street-debut-of-trumps-truth-social-network-could-net-him-stock-worth-billions-on-paper.html><span>←</span><span>Wall Street debut of Trumps Truth Social network could net him stock worth billions on paper</span></a>
