I promise. take a step away, stay strong, have faith in your path, walk in your truth and the clouds will start to clear up," she wrote at the time. "I have so much gratitude for and perspective on life , this 100+ days of Lyme, chronic disease, co infection treatment, almost 15 years of invisible suffering, was all worth it if I’m able to, God willing, have a lifetime of spreading love from a full cup, and being able to truly be myself, For the first time ever."</p><p>In addition to stepping back from modeling, Hadid has also moved to Texas, where she's embarking on a new chapter with her friends and boyfriend, Adan Banuelos.</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>The 27-year-old described it to the mag as "the best time," adding that now that she has the space and opportunity to do things for herself, she feelings "genuinely" happy.</p><p>"For the first time now, I'm not putting on a fake face. If I don't feel good, I won't go. If I don't feel good, I take time for myself. And I've never had the opportunity to do that or say that before," Hadid stated simply. "Now when anybody sees me in pictures and they say, I look happy, I genuinely am. I am feeling better; my bad days now were my old good days."</p><p>Part of that shift in mindset has opened her up to new business opportunities, including starting her own fragrance line, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>'Ôrəbella</strong></a>, pronounced "aura-bella," a blend of Hadid, which means "iron ore" in Arabic, and her first name.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:996b1662-0ac3-49b2-aabb-809e8cedd361 data-container-ref=toofab:article:114caf6e-00ae-45e7-ae0f-c7d89a5a30fb data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2023/09/15/6430dc674e224084be344fed10623e07_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Bella Hadid Appears to Debut Shaved Head for Marc Jacobs Campaign</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In a way, Hadid said the line is a "family" business.</p><p>"Growing up in an Arab family, perfume and scents were almost a personality trait -- I can still remember the way my grandparents smelled when they walked into a room," Hadid recalled. "My uncle Mahmoud was making his own essential oils in the 70s -- woody, tobacco-smelling scents."</p><p>Shutting down the idea that this is just another celebrity fragrance line, Hadid said the idea for Ôrəbella came about amid the former model's search for an alternative to the many alcohol-based fragrances that often come out of major perfume houses.</p><p>"I get hives and rashes from stress alone, so I tend to stay away from anything that will trigger my body nowadays," Hadid said, before detailing how she concocted some of her own scents at home -- a mix of essential oils from a health food store near her family's Pennsylvania farm and glycerin.</p><p>"I was trying to make them as unique as possible so that when I put them on my body, it felt singular to me," she explained. "I didn't want to just put something on the market that was another product or another perfume. It was something I was already extremely passionate about, and I didn't want to keep it for myself anymore."</p><a id=gallery-link-0ffe37de-6b8d-56f6-b16c-e85ac0cff6cc class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:0ffe37de-6b8d-56f6-b16c-e85ac0cff6cc data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:114caf6e-00ae-45e7-ae0f-c7d89a5a30fb data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e1/4by3/2022/05/26/e1c7332f3a5c42d29e1f6632cbb79b8e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j25maWlfl7KtuMBmn5qcmZl6tLTAq5ysZaedxm6%2Fx55knZ2TnrGmsIytpmaskaCybq2MrKueqF2XrqS3jJ%2BpqKVdorylscuipaBn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./520512-who-peter-doocy-married-journalist-hillary-vaughn.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Peter Doocy married to?
