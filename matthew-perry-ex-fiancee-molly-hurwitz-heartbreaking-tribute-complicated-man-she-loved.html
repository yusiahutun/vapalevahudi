"'F--k, I was so good!! See what I did there???'"</p><p>"We rewound and studied scenes. Our respect and appreciation of humor is something that connected us," she continued. "Being with him as he rediscovered his brilliance was magical."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>She also touched on his depths as a human being, while hinting at the challenges they faced together, and perhaps what ultimately would drive them apart.</p><p>"I obviously knew that man in a very different way, too," she wrote. "While I loved him deeper than I could comprehend, he was complicated, and he caused pain like I’d never known."</p><p>"No one in my adult life has had a more profound impact on me than Matthew Langford Perry," Hurwitz continued.

She said she feels relief that Perry is at peace, while also noting, "he would love that the world is talking about how talented he was. And he really was very talented."</p><p>While Perry might have finally come to recognize his talent by revisiting his most famous work ahead of that Max reunion, he's said that he generally tries to avoid dipping in on Friends for one very heartbreaking and raw reason.</p><p>Speaking with Tom Power in November 2022, per <a href=#><strong>Slashfilm</strong></a>, Perry said that he couldn't bring himself to watch the show because "I could go drinking ... opiates ... drinking ... cocaine. Like I could tell season by season by how I looked."</p><p>Instead of being able to enjoy the humor or friendship between the cast members, Perry can't help but break down what his various addiction struggles are based on how his character looks.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a5321e43-4f32-44b2-9bc8-7c6dfa966ab3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:befb0be3-8a93-4267-9202-f69425dda94d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/42/5by4/2022/11/01/42f45d199c28456492b9af186eff92bc_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Matthew Perry Reveals Drunken Sex Fail, Career Salaries, and Claims He Beat Up Justin Trudeau in Tell-All Memoir</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>In an excerpt shared to <a href=#><strong>People</strong></a> from his memoir Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, which came out last year, Perry wrote, "You can track the trajectory of my addiction if you gauge my weight from season to season -- when I'm carrying weight, it's alcohol; when I'm skinny, it's pills. When I have a goatee, it's lots of pills."</p><p>At the same time, he told Power he wanted to change his attitude about the show and try and immerse himself in this show that remains this cultural experience that's now touched multiple generations.</p><p>"It's become this important, significant thing and I, you know, I would watch that again. It was really funny and all the people were nice," he said. "And I've been too worried about this."</p><p>You can see how his Friends co-stars, creators, family and friends paid tribute to Perry in the stories below.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:49e7c3cc-38d8-44b4-8c91-060c155506b4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:befb0be3-8a93-4267-9202-f69425dda94d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/54/5by4/2021/05/13/545ac93eb6694546b1151cafbfc578cd_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Matthew Perry's 'Devastated' Friends Costars Release Joint Statement After His Death</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:188e199d-3fa5-4496-ac81-d3af1052c57f data-container-ref=toofab:article:befb0be3-8a93-4267-9202-f69425dda94d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/69/5by4/2023/10/30/695d97d2afe54f618f3b4b8196cc08b2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Salma Hayek Shares 'Profound Sadness' Over Matthew Perry Death</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:fc7ec158-d107-47db-817c-7565d679841c data-container-ref=toofab:article:befb0be3-8a93-4267-9202-f69425dda94d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0d/5by4/2023/10/30/0d91b90eeb084f96ab2db8370441e294_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty / Everett</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kathleen Turner Reflects on TV Son Matthew Perry: 'Extremely Sad'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e98313e8-ba95-4c59-a397-71d6c5bd276c data-container-ref=toofab:article:befb0be3-8a93-4267-9202-f69425dda94d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/a2/5by4/2023/10/30/a2d83b56456942a5bba09401cad7fbaa_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Ione Skye Shares Final Text Messages From Matthew Perry in Heartbreakingly Sweet Post</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:695abcf6-6d53-41a4-bf2f-de8663fae059 data-container-ref=toofab:article:befb0be3-8a93-4267-9202-f69425dda94d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/06/5by4/2023/10/29/067be571c08f4af5a4868d4cb54fe2c3_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Matthew Perry Dead at 54: Friends Stars, Celebrity Friends and Fans React</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGlmbGhfoq61wMeermaolae%2FunnEsWSfoZGjsKaxjKampaSpYrW2vtaiq7NlmJqus8DBq5yao5mjtG7A0aKZrqyVYrCwuc%2BloJyZpJqxbrnAp2SsoJViubDCxJ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ariana-grande-and-dalton-gomezs-separation-date-revealed-as-they-file-for-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Ariana Grande and Dalton Gomez's 'separation date' revealed as they file for divorce</span></a>
