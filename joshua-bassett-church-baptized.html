"my heart is for Christ and Christ alone!"</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>i visited this church and happened to get baptized here- i was unaware of some of their policies and beliefs, and do not endorse all of them.<br>my heart is for Christ and Christ alone!</p>— Joshua Bassett (@joshuatbassett) <a href=#>February 13, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@joshuatbassett</a><p>Bassett's religious tweets started shortly after the new year, when he sent out a message on January 5 reading, "Jesus Christ is the only way. &nbsp;His death and resurrection are historically documented. turn away form hate, &nbsp;seek forgiveness and come home to Him."</p><p>As some wondered whether he was hacked, the posts kept coming on his Instagram Stories, where he opened up about his spiritual journey.</p><p>"A few months ago I asked God to 'send me a sign when I write the truth.' I typed 'Jesus is the way,' nothing happened, then I added, 'Jesus is the *only* way' and the light turned on in my living room," he claimed, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>. "I have also first hand encountered Jesus twice. The experience's [sic] were richer and more vivid than anything in my entire life. I look forward to speaking about it soon."</p><p>He then added, "For those concerned about me be sure of this: I'm better than I have ever been. The peace I feel is far beyond what I thought possible."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:de24d031-2bd1-4aa3-b262-1d2d3f0175fd data-container-ref=toofab:article:b5540dc3-cc35-409a-872a-043153d92243 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0f/5by4/2021/06/24/0fc58317b9fb41ad91c75e4d7b4e8438_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Andy Jackson/GQ</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Joshua Bassett 'Wasn't Joking' In 'Coming Out Video,' Reveals Near-Death Experience</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2tmamtfn7y0tNSaZJuZo6iytcCMnJ%2BuqpOdeqOtz62gs52UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./3-high-protein-chip-dips.html><span>←</span><span>3 High-Protein Chip Dips for Any Summer Barbecue</span></a>
