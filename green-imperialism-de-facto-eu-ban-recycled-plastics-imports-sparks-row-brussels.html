EU targets Chinese plastics under drive to counter ‘unfair’ trade practice
Should the recycled plastic not meet the same standards required of producers in the EU, it would not be permitted to enter the single market, threatening huge disruptions to global trade."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
