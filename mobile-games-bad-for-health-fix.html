Mobile Games Are Designed to Be Addictive</h2><p>The first reason that mobile games are harming your health is that they’re specifically designed to be addictive. You're set up to lose, here.</p><p>Behavioral addiction specialists at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Delamere</a> explain that playing video games engages with the brain’s reward center, releasing dopamine to keep players coming back for more. The World Health Organization (WHO) has gone as far as officially classifying video game addiction as a mental health disorder.</p><p>Video Game Addiction is diagnosed through symptoms including being unable to control your desire to play video games, prioritizing gaming over everything else (including obligations), and not stopping playing games even when negative side effects are noticed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=what-aspects-of-mobile-games-make-them-so-addictive>What Aspects of Mobile Games Make Them So Addictive?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/what-makes-mobile-games-so-addictive.jpg><p>While many people's gaming habits are unlikely to fit the diagnosis of Video Game Addiction, the reasons that mobile games are so addictive are clear:</p><ul><li><strong>Creators favor dopamine hits over quality gameplay</strong>. Many mobile games are designed to provide frequent and consistent dopamine hits for low-effort gaming, rather than providing quality gameplay and narratives found in popular console games. By creating small “wins” within mobile games, creators are compelling you to keep playing to receive frequent dopamine hits for each small achievement.</li><li><strong>Games are free to play</strong>. Creating an accessible game is vital in hooking an audience, which is why many mobile game designers will offer their games for free, removing any monetary barrier that would prevent you from engaging with their product.</li><li><strong>Mobile games start easy</strong>. Mobile game creators also hook you by creating mobile games that allow you to move through the first few levels quickly. This makes a game exciting to play as you receive plenty of dopamine hits from the get-go. As more levels are achieved, the difficulty increases, along with the dopamine-infused sense of achievement you receive for overcoming the set challenges.</li><li><strong>Mobile games are accessible to all</strong>. It seems like nearly everyone owns a mobile phone, meaning that mobile game creators have the largest accessible audience in the gaming sphere (approximately 3.9 billion players according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business of Apps</a>). You have a wealth of (mostly free) addictive mobile games readily available in your hand at all times.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=real-time-demands-of-mobile-games-cause-anxiety>2. Real-Time Demands of Mobile Games Cause Anxiety</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/real-time-demands-of-mobile-games-can-prey-on-anxiety.jpg><p>Aside from the anxiety-inducing addictive nature of mobile gaming, players are easily pressured into experiencing anxiety-related FOMO (fear of missing out) when it comes to playing mobile games.</p><p>Many mobile games run in real-time, with limited-time events running 24/7. These limited-run events can occur any time day or night within a mobile game, and potentially missing the deadline of a particular game aspect can manifest anxiety in dedicated players.</p><p>The creators of these limited-time events execute the same strategy that effective marketers use in advertising: by creating a sense of scarcity and urgency, you as the player are compelled into participating in these short-lived and heart-palpitating events to avoid missing out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To ensure this anxiety-driven gaming response isn’t escaped, creators also use mobile game notifications to draw you back in. Game notifications inform you about these time-limited in-game events, inducing a manipulative compulsion to participate or “lose out” even when you’re not playing the game.</p><h2 id=mobile-games-detain-you-from-your-real-life>3. Mobile Games Detain You From Your Real Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mobiles-games-can-detain-you-from-real-life-1.jpg><p>With the compulsive nature of these games, you may find yourself constantly engaged with your favorite mobile game—whether through actual gameplay or via distracted preoccupation. This can occur when the line between escapism through mobile gaming slips into obsession, and it’s not hard to overstep this line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you find yourself in social situations either glued to your phone or preoccupied with thoughts about your current mobile game, you may have crossed the line into mobile game obsession.</p><h2 id=mobile-games-can-lead-you-to-shed-money-through-microtransactions>4. Mobile Games Can Lead You to Shed Money Through Microtransactions</h2><p>It’s easy to see that <a href=#>microtransactions are ruining the gaming industry</a>, especially when they’re put into play in a predatory way. Many gamers also dislike microtransactions, as they can give an unfair advantage to players who splash out to advance their in-game progress.</p><p>It’s common within mobile games for the ability to progress to a reasonable level to be unachievable without purchasing specific in-game items with real money. If you’re fully committed (read: obsessed) with your mobile game, you’re just an easy tap away from spending real dollars in exchange for virtual game progress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=long-mobile-gaming-sessions-can-damage-your-body>5.

Turn Off Mobile Game Notifications</h3><p>An effective way of combating mobile gaming addiction and related anxiety is to turn off notifications. Many mobile games will push you to log back in throughout the day via persistent reminders, so find your notifications settings on your phone and turn off notifications from your games to ease your anxiety.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-to-protect-yourself-from-mobile-gaming.jpg><h3 id=set-a-time-limit-on-mobile-games>2.
