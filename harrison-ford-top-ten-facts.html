Acting runs in Harrison's genes. His mother, Dorothy, was a former radio actress and his father, Christopher, was a former actor turned advertising executive. He also has a younger brother called Terence, an actor and photographer.</p><p id=eZCRIXQWxHJq data-wc=47>2.

On learning this, director <a class=hm-link href=#>Steven Spielberg</a> decided to make young Indy a Life Scout in</p><p id=eS-4AAPqMLS9 data-wc=25>3. Harrison's route into acting wasn’t totally planned; he initially only attended a drama class in his senior year at college to overcome his shyness.</p><p id=eb06PBK85h data-wc=53>4. He shares his name with a silent film actor also named Harrison Ford, who died in 1957. To avoid any confusion, Ford called himself "Harrison J. Ford" in his first movie credit, the 1967 film . The "J" doesn’t actually stand for anything, as Harrison has no middle name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/055b59381711-harrison-z.jpg><p id=eOqtkofk--1g data-wc=94>5. The Hollywood star has experienced a phenomenally successful career, but this wasn’t always the case. When he first started out, Harrison was unhappy with the film roles he was offered, so became a self-taught professional carpenter to support his young family.This is how he met <span><strong>George Lucas</strong></span>, who would go on to cast him as "Han Solo" in the franchise. The director hired Harrison to build cabinets at his home, but after learning the craftsman was actually an actor, he gave him a role in his 1973 film</p><p id=eind8CTymG4h data-wc=37>6. It's hard to imagine anyone else playing Indiana Jones, but that almost happened. Tom Selleck was initially offered the role in , but Harrison was cast when Tom was unable to accept.</p><p id=epLM-Laf-JL data-wc=33>7.
