He was found guilty of the crime twice and has served ten years in prison for the crime. The David Temple murder case, although having gone through court twice, is yet to be closed completely, more than two decades later.</p><h2>David Temple timeline</h2><p class=align-left>David Temple's trial for the murder of his wife has lasted for more than two decades. Here is a breakdown of the David Temple case through the years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jana Reynolds's story: What really happened and latest updates</span></p></a><h3>1992: Belinda and David Temple get married</h3><p class=align-left>David and Belinda got married in 1992. The two met when they were studying at Stephen F. Austin State University. After completing their university education, they were both employed as high school teachers.</p><p class=align-left>Belinda was a special education teacher, whereas David was a football coach. They were blessed with a son named Evan Temple. At the time of her death, Belinda was eight months pregnant with a baby girl.</p><h3>January 1999: Belinda Temple found dead in her house</h3><p class=align-left>On January 11, 1999, Belinda Temple received a phone call from the Daycare centre where she used to take her son, informing him that he had a fever. She immediately left work and rushed to pick him from the daycare. Given that he had a meeting at work, he called her husband in to take care of Evan that afternoon.</p><p class=align-left>When she came back from work, she passed at her in-law's house to pick soup for Evan, and that was the last time she was seen alive. When David came home, he noticed that the back door glass was broken and suspected home invasion. He took his son Evan across the street to a neighbour's house. David came back to the house to check on Belinda.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4c9e1ad146f21c0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to the Vaughn family? Trial, documentary, updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When he arrived at the house, he found his wife dead in her closet. According to the investigators, she was killed execution-style by a 12-gauge shotgun. She and her unborn child died from a single gunshot blast to the back of her head from close range.</p><p class=align-left>The initial investigations into the murder pointed at Riley Joe Sanders, a teenage neighbour, as the killer. He held a grudge against the deceased for telling his parents he had repeatedly skipped school.</p><h3>2001: David Temple and Heather Scott get married</h3><p class=align-left>A few days before Belinda's death, Heather and David had confessed their love for one another. Although they tried to downplay the relationship, they got married in June 2001. Their marriage came less than two years after Belinda was murdered.</p><h3>2004: Temple indicted in his wife's murder</h3><p class=align-left>After a series of investigations, Temple was indicted for the murder of his wife in 2004. The evidence presented at the trial cleared Sanders as the suspect of the murder. After piecing the evidence together, the prosecutors came to the conclusion that her husband murdered her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f7865451201674c6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The Hendricks family murder case: What happened and latest updates</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6c7dc028956d79eb.jpg><p class=align-left>According to the prosecutors, the home invasion was staged. One of the prosecutors, Kelly Siegler, argued there were holes in Temple's alibi. David was having an affair with Heather at the time, and he wanted to end his marriage so that he could be with her.</p><h3>2007: Temple found guilty of his wife's murder</h3><p class=align-left>The jurist at Harry County found David guilty of the murder of his wife. This ruling came after the murder trial began in the fall of 2007. In the case, he was represented by Dick DeGuerin, a famous Texas defense attorney. Kelly Siegler was the attorney for the case.</p><p class=align-left>During the trial, Belinda Temple's twin sister described the relationship between David and his wife as antagonistic. After a four-week-long trial, he was convicted of murder in November 2007 and sentenced to life in prison.</p><h3>2012: Stephen Clappart's new findings</h3><p class=align-left>Stephen Clappart was an investigator for the Attorney's Office in Harris County District. As he began to investigate and go through the case files, a new tip came in on the case.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8601c7c1939bc9ee.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Timothy Madden: Gabbi Doolin murder sentence and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He felt that the trial was unfair and had doubts about whether David had killed his wife. He turned over the new findings to the appellate attorneys in the Temple case, Stanley Schneider and Casie Gotro.</p><h3>2015: A new hearing</h3><p class=align-left>In 2015, Temple's appellate attorneys secured a new hearing for the case after a close examination of the latest findings. They made their case to the judge and raised the argument that prosecutors hid or delayed revealing hundreds of pages of evidence to the defense team during the trial. Kelly Siegler, who prosecuted the case against the accused, was called to testify.</p><p class=align-left>At the end of the month-long hearing in 2015, the jury sided with the defense team. He listed 36 items of evidence that should have been turned over to the defense by prosecutors or which were turned over too late to be of use. The jurist recommended that David be given a new trial.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f4e1aaedcfca73f1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kakamega Boy Who Went Missing Returns Home One Year Later from the Streets</span></p></a><h3>2016: Case overturned</h3><p class=align-left>In November 2016, David was an elated man when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned his conviction. On December 28, 2016, he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">released from prison </a>on bond. His brothers and parents were waiting outside to welcome him.</p><p class=align-left>Belinda's family members were not happy with the ruling and said they still believed that David was guilty of Belinda's murder.</p><h3>2019: Jury founds David guilty of Belinda's murder the second time</h3><p class=align-left>In June 2019, Temple's retrial got underway. Four days into the trial, Temple's wife Heather filed for divorce from Temple, citing a "conflict of personalities" in her marriage. The new prosecutor told the jury the break-in details on the day of the fateful incident appeared staged.</p><p class=align-left>It was abnormal that nothing was stolen from the house during the break-in, and the family's dog didn't prevent the intruder from entering the home. The neighbourhood had no history of crime, and no burglar would break into the house in the middle of the day.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Mike Tyson's daughter? Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For 18 days, the jury keenly listened to witnesses' testimony, and both sides presented their case. On August 6, 2019, after a retrial, the jury took eight hours to deliberate on the case verdict. They found Temple guilty of murdering his pregnant wife in their Katy home and ruled that he should go back to prison.</p><p class=align-left>Afterward, the jury deliberated for 19 hours, over three days, on the sentencing, but they could not reach a unanimous agreement on the matter. Therefore, they rescheduled the hearing for the sentencing of this case to a later date.</p><h3>March 2020: Temple's next court appearance rescheduled</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c4c9e1ad146f21c0.jpg><p class=align-left>Temple's next court appearance was scheduled for March 2020, when a new jury would convene to determine his punishment. However, Temple's retrial and sentencing, who had been found guilty twice, was delayed again <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">because of the pandemic</a>. Where is David Temple now? Currently, he is in jail but without a sentence.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/205965561d56420c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>UK Woman Dies of Cancer 5 Days after Emotional Hospital Wedding</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The story of David Temple is one that many people are still having a hard time trying to unravel. It is surprising that Belinda's family still waits for justice in what is considered one of the most horrible crimes to have occurred in Katy, TX, 22 years after she was murdered. They can only hope and pray that justice will prevail in the end.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke </a>reported on how <a href=#>George Floyd's trial prosecutors </a>asked the court to move his case to June due to COVID-19. George Floyd, the black man whose death resulted in worldwide Black Lives Matter protests could see a delay in his murder case trial. The defense legal team representing the four officers is also asking for more time to prepare for the trial</p><p class=align-left>According to TMZ, the murder case prosecutors had filed legal documents seeking to continue the trial from June 7 and because of the recent approval of two COVID-19 vaccines set to be rolled out in the US. The case is believed to be a high-profile one that could attract fresh protests that could spread the novel when the trial is in session.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8f29b5268dca4970.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>List of all Texas female death row inmates and their crimes</span></p></a><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCAj2tnbHFdqbWmedKtpquxXZmut7XDZquepaChsm7Dx56pnmaYqbqt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./movie-star-ethan-hawke-will-never-fix-his-crooked-teeth-after-watching-tv.html><span>←</span><span>Movie star Ethan Hawke will never fix his crooked teeth after watching TV</span></a>
