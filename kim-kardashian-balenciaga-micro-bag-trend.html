Eagle-eyed fans of the reality star will note that her outfit was almost identical to that which she wore back in August to a party held to celebrate her younger sister <a class=hm-link href=#>Kendall Jenner</a>'s 818 Tequila brand in the Little Beach House Malibu in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dc9bfe93c77c-kim-kardashian-micro-bag-bodysuit-z.jpg><p id=enbwSqL9Ryh3 data-wc=58>In a post<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow> shared on Instagram with her 332m followers</a>, Kim looked stylish in a high-necked greyish blue skin-tight catsuit which celebrated her insane figure, showing off her every curve. The backless design presented a level of necessary contrast and added an overtly sexy feel. "Oh ok well I didn’t look like this in mine. Ha," joked sister Khloé in the comments. Us neither, sadly.</p><p id=eG0_kDEp_jzF data-wc=30>The 41-year-old's cool neutral colour palette even extended to her choice of footwear, with the SKIMS founder sporting a pair of fossil grey knee-high boots with a futuristic wedge heel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f7f157ad4645-kim-kardashian-backless-bodysuit-micro-bag-z.jpg><p id=esP4wqQrUocN data-wc=25>But forget Kim's colour coordination for a second, rather what caught our eye was her diamanté Balenciaga micro bag that she clutched in one hand.</p><p id=eR_Me6POf2-C data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>What Kim Kardashian's Milan Fashion Week wardrobe has taught us about vintage power dressing</a></strong></p><p id=eGeOq7LYZmCj data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Kardashian rewears unreal jewel-encrusted vintage Dolce & Gabbana corset</a></strong></p><p id=e_ZepfMybnGe data-wc=55>What the mini bag lacks in spaciousness, it more than makes up for in style. The teeny tiny trend has been all over the runway in recent seasons, most notably within cult label Jacquemus' collections. Its adorable Le Chiquito style has amassed an adoring following, having been seen on the likes of <a class=hm-link href=#>Dua Lipa</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Emily Ratajkowski</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Selena Gomez</a>.</p><p id=eNTq9Y4DOUgc data-wc=28>Kim's love for micro accessories is still going strong, and her encrusted silver Hourglass bag is the living proof.
