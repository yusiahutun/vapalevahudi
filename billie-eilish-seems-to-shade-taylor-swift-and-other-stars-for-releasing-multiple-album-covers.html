We’ve all got to do our part, and that means <a href=#>celebrities</a> too!</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-2091027784-1024x772.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-eilish-slammed-big-artists-like-taylor-swift>Billie Eilish slammed ‘big artists’ like Taylor Swift</h2><p>During a recent Billboard interview, the Bad Guy singer <a href=# rel=nofollow>dragged</a> unnamed celebrities for releasing countless products in the hopes of making a few extra bucks.</p><p>“We live in this day and age where, for some reason, it’s very important to some artists to make all sorts of different vinyl and packaging … which ups the sales and ups the numbers and gets them more money and gets them more,” <a href=#>Billie Eilish</a> scathed.</p><p>The 22-year-old <a href=#>music</a> star said she struggled to find the words to describe just how “wasteful” the process is.</p><p>She continued: “It is right in front of our faces and people are just getting away with it left and right, and I find it really frustrating as somebody who really goes out of my way to be sustainable and do the best that I can and try to involve everybody in my team in being sustainable — and then it’s some of the biggest artists in the world making f***ing 40 different vinyl packages that have a different unique thing just to get you to keep buying more.”</p><p>True fans will know that Billie is a staunch defender of the environment, having released a black version of her album with 100 percent recycled black vinyl and shrink wrap made from sugar cane.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-think-they-know-who-billie-was-referring-to>Fans think they know who Billie was referring to</h2><p>Considering Billie said everyone’s “favorite artists” are essentially destroying the environment, it doesn’t take Sherlock Holmes to speculate on who she could mean. Perhaps it could be the singer who is partial to private jets.</p><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> is also set to release <a href=#>The Tortured Poets Department album</a> in four different variations, each containing 16 songs, unique artwork, and a special bonus track.</p><p>On X, formally known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>, one person joked: “She clocked Taylor so bad I’m crying.”</p><p>“She ain’t say no artist in particular, but a certain fandom felt hit,” another person hinted. A third said: “Is this the ‘controversial’ thing everyone’s talking about? Seems like she’s just speaking the truth.”</p><p>Naturally, the Swifties came to their leader’s defense as one person penned: “But… didn’t she release a ton of variants for her vinyl/cassettes as well as some special edition splattered paint ones? Like did she forget orrr.”</p><p>Another replied: “This is why I only stan Taylor. All her peers secretly hate her for being successful and will resort to passive aggressiveness and hypocrisy just to belittle and diminish her success.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eGcK7IpaOinV2atq210qFkrJ2VosBuwM5mqqGZlJp6ta3YpaarZaOstqfAjJqlnWWfqbWmvoysq5qqo2KzsL6Mq5ylnZGotq%2BzjKaspayZpbmmecClma6lXZi8t7HRrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-ultimate-list-of-hottest-male-celebrities-1214212.html><span>←</span><span>The ultimate list of hottest male celebrities of all time</span></a>
