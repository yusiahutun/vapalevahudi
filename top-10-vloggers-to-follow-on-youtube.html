The genre with the widest array of creators and differing content, the world of vlogging is a most colorful one. You can easily share anything you want about yourself with the world through a video and then become a vlogger. Here are the top 10 vloggers to follow on YouTube.</p><p>Read below for the details or watch the full compilation here!</p><p></p><h2>10. A Controversial Start: James Charles</h2><p>When we think of James Charles, the first thing that comes to our mind is his beauty content. But James Charles is also someone who vlogs a lot. Although he always manages to get into all the fights on social media, his vlogs get a lot of views. It’s up to you whether to take James as a vlogger or not, but before you decide, let’s take a look at what James did in one day.</p><p></p><h2>9. Devon Lee Carlson</h2><p>A new age vlogger who commands a comparatively modest following, this rising star of the genre seems poised to become a big name actor in the scene. Although a lesser known creator, devon works with some of the biggest clothing brands, and her followers are always eager to listen to her advice when it comes to style.</p><p></p><h2>8. Rayawashere</h2><p>The sweet couple Raya and Louis aims to inspire their followers by shooting vlogs about their travels. Raya sometimes makes videos about her daily routines and beauty secrets as well. Her videos are always positive and full of life. Sometimes we see other vloggers join her videos too, which creates an even more entertaining atmosphere. Here is a vlog of Raya for you to enjoy.</p><p></p><h2>7. AllasYummyFood</h2><p>If you are a foodie, you will love this vlogger suggestion. Alla, who is a chef and a food expert, shares her recipes and experiences with food. Her videos are both informative and delicious. I wouldn’t suggest watching her videos if you’re hungry, though. She usually makes short videos about her recipes, and this makes the videos easier to watch. Here is a delicious example for you to enjoy.</p><p></p><h2>6. Tanya Burr</h2><p>Tanya is an actor as well as an influencer, and she generally shoots videos on styling and beauty. But the videos she makes on her daily life with her friends and her shopping trips are worth watching. Here is a Q&A video for you to know Tanya better.</p><p></p><h2>5. Romee Strijd</h2><p>We all know Romee Strijd. She is a well-known model of Victoria’s Secret, and she loves to share vlogs on her Youtube channel now. Her vlogs include her workout, diet, friends; basically her whole life. Since she had a baby recently, we see a lot of cuteness in her vlogs! Watch this video for overdosing on cuteness.</p><p></p><h2>4. Nikie Tutorials</h2><p>The world famous beauty creator and a standalone icon, Nikke founded an empire on her beauty vlogs. Emmassing over 14 million subscribers. Nikkie also converted her success online to being an on-screen personality known worldwide. Her shift away from online content creation however is why ve chose to put her in fourth place on our list.</p><p></p><h2>3. FunForLouis</h2><p>Known for his infotainment content, Louis is another vlogger that deserves a high spot on our list. Although he generally shares what he does in a day, his content is very interesting and entertaining because the things he does in a day are most unordinary indeed. He also loves traveling and through his vlogs, he gives the opportunity to join in on the journey! Here is one such adventure.</p><p></p><h2>2. Casey Neistat</h2><p>I can’t think of anything more enjoyable than watching Casey Neistat’s vlogs. The original vlog creator takes the vice lead on our list. Casey, who usually shoots lifestyle videos, is a master of this business. While his videos are entertaining, they also shine a light on current problems in the world. He creates captivating videos professionally and keeps you locked to the screen. If you don’t believe me, watch this video of Casey.</p><p></p><h2>1. Emma Chamberlain</h2><p>Topping out our list is the queen of social media. With her vlogs, Emma sets the baseline and creates the quintessential vlog. She is very successful in actively using all of her social media accounts and following trends. Emma, who vlogs almost everything, is very professional in this. From styling to cooking, you can find anything you look for in her vlogs. Here is an example of Emma’s usual vlog:</p><p></p><p><strong>What do you think about our selections?
