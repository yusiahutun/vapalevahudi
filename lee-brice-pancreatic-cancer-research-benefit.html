"Lee Brice and his team did an amazing job for our pancreas patients."</p><p>"Our financial assistance programs will continue to allow patients access to potentially lifesaving treatments and peer to peer support," she continues. "As Nikki used to say, 'I just felt my heart smile.'"</p><p>Brice performed at the Bowery in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on Oct. 8, with a handful of other country artists. <a href=#>Randy Houser</a>, <a href=#>Jamey Johnson</a> and <a href=#>Jerrod Niemann</a> also took the stage to help raise money for the foundation.</p><p>"Nights like this make me love what I do even more... not only do I get to sing and play with my brothers, but we’re making a difference," Brice shares on social media. "Thank you @nikkimitchellfoundation"</p><p><a href=#>The Nikki Mitchell Foundation</a> was set up to help fight pancreatic cancer after Mitchell herself was diagnosed in 2010. She lost her battle in 2013, but her legacy lives on through the non-profit, which is dedicated to providing comfort and relief to those who are battling the disease. All money raised goes toward caring for patients, new technology for early detection and ultimately a cure for all.</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>The Top 40 Country Songs of 2023, Ranked</h2><p>The best country songs of 2023 fit snugly over your life and experiences.
