Aphasia is a form of brain damage which affects ones ability to communicate -- and is initially <a href=#><strong>what Bruce Willis was diagnosed with</strong></a> before the family received his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis.</p><p>"I woke up from a coma, without any words," said Tatum, 59. "I was in a coma and nobody could figure out if I was going to die or if I was going to live. And I lived."</p><p>According to the publication, O'Neal has "fought to regain her full memory," and has been undergoing numerous therapies at different facilities under medical supervision for the past couple years. Her son said that, "at times, it was touch and go," as he feared she would be "blind, deaf, and potentially might never speak again."</p><p>"I've been trying to get sober my whole life. Every day, I am trying," O'Neal -- who has been very open about her battles with substance abuse through the years -- told People. "I was an addict my whole life. Pretty much on and off, for the past 30 to 40 years. No more drugs. No more piulls. I don't want to use anymore."</p><p>Her son says it appears his mother has "embraced this attempt at recovery," while she added she wants "to be with my beautiful three kids." Her daughter Emily, meanwhile, called her "an unbelievable survivor."</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health or addiction, contact the SAMHSA helpline at 1-800-662-HELP.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:7bd9c850-641c-53c9-9e22-23c774382b38 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2fb8a2ec-aac2-4d45-9de6-04fb0ec79a1d data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=30><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/19/5by4/2018/03/29/19990de9d1c555aba6247f5a2fcef071_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Tatum O'Neal Rips Wendy Williams After Interview: 'She Was Crazy, Like, Literally' (Update)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmaW1fqa61wcxmpqedkaF6tMDRqKKeZZ%2BrsrOwzqycaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./macaulay-culkin-makes-rare-appearance-with-fiancee-brenda-song-for-glamorous-date-night.html><span>←</span><span>Macaulay Culkin makes rare appearance with fiance Brenda Song for glamorous date night</span></a>
