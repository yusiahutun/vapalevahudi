Describing Meghan as "quiet but very sweet," Gleave revealed, "I remember her being very focused on her acting career and her role as a briefcase beauty, as we were called, was just a stepping stone in her career. She only did a few seasons and then landed her role in Suits which took her away. I was so happy for her when I heard about the marriage."</p><img alt="deal or new deal season 2" title="Deal or New Deal - Season 2" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/season-2-pictured-meghan-markle-photo-by-paul-drinkwater-news-photo-1596378910.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">NBC</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gleave's comments mirror what Meghan has said about her time on Deal or No Deal.

She continued, "I went from working in the U.S. Embassy in Argentina to ending up on Deal. It's run the gamut. Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing. So if that's a way for me to gloss over that subject, then I will happily shift gears into something else."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaa2NphnKClnJmpp2Xna6vecyaqaSklWKxpq3LZqarZZ6keqWxwKVkpaGjlnqouMSarZ5lmaPBpr7VopywZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ideausa-atomicx-v201-review.html><span>←</span><span>IdeaUSA AtomicX V201 Noise Cancelling Wireless Headphones Review</span></a>
