It's about channelling a precise moment in fashion history and re-visiting those iconic style makers from the golden age of Hollywood. Think of Renée Zellweger carrying the Chanel reissue in the Judy Garland biopic, Elizabeth Taylor or Audrey Hepburn in the 1960s. There's a magic to those vintage pieces which only adds to their allure.”</span></p><p id=elVtG03WVVkD data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>Vintage designer clothing: 5 items that never go out of style</a></strong></p><p id=eVxV2ont3flG data-wc=42>If you're looking to make your first investment into buying a vintage Chanel bag there are of course key things you should be looking out for…&nbsp;<strong>We asked Jackariaeh to share his top tips on making your first vintage Chanel bag purchase.</strong></p><h2><strong>What to know before you buy a vintage Chanel bag</strong></h2><p id=en6NI2fZcffL data-wc=61>First and foremost, make sure you always buy from a reputable reseller, avoid buying from online auction sites unless you have buyer money back guarantee or protection, never bank transfer unless a trusted seller. The market is saturated with mirror image counterfeits and however good the photos are if the price is way to good to be true, it probably is.</p><h2><strong><span>How can I tell if my vintage Chanel is in good condition?</span></strong></h2><p id=eteB0sz0Q-5C data-wc=95><span>Buying a piece in excellent to good condition is very important after you ensure the piece is 100% authentic. Check the condition, over paying on a piece with heavy corner wear or has had a trip to a handbag spa and has been repainted I try to avoid if possible… unless the price is extremely reasonable. Light corner touch up is fine as long as it’s done well. I myself know we all need a little maintenance after kicking around on this planet for a few years. Treat your handbag like you would your skin.</span></p><p id=e6_ZBttWXBJB data-wc=1><strong><span>READ:&nbsp;</span><a class=hm-link href=#>The history of Chanel perfume: everything you need to know about the maison's most famous fragrances</a></strong></p><p id=ehhLXu7PQ5gJ data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Historical handbags and their muses: Why Launer is The Queen's favourite handbag brand</a></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Which style of vintage Chanel bag should I buy?</span></strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b040c97fff0d-vintage-chanel-bag-z.jpg><p id=ekdJvUBxUMFI data-wc=5><strong>Invest in a classic colourway</strong></p><p id=eR1spIaPJv7v data-wc=42><span>There is nothing like buying a beautiful black classic Chanel with gold or palladium hardware, I always say buy timeless pieces, avoid trends and remember if you look after this piece like a small wearable savings account it will pay you dividends.</span></p><h2><strong>What material should I go for?</strong></h2><p id=ela6J7uVxR6b data-wc=63>Find out exactly what leather works best for your lifestyle, lambskin is a far more delicate leather if you’re a lady or gent who’s heavier on their handbags than we recommend caviar or calf leather as they are far more durable, because let’s face it your bag may end up looking like its had two rounds with Mike Tyson if you choose unwisely.</p><h2><strong>Do Chanel bags go up in value?</strong></h2><p id=eVORXK8h-KcH data-wc=64>Chanel increases the prices of their classic design handbags year on year. Since the pandemic the cost of production and labour has meant that supply can't keep up with demand. Consequently the secondary market is booming so if you are in a financial position to buy a vintage classic flap don't hesitate as it's an investment in style you won't regret.
