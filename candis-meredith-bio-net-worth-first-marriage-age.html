Because of the accusations, Magnolia Network has pulled the show from Discovery Plus’ streaming platform and the cable network.</p><p>As the story goes, Joanna Gaines, host of ‘Upper Fixer’ DMed the joint IG account of Andy and Candis in 2021.

But, then they shared that they would charge an extra $5000 making it a total of $25,000 in the first week.</p><p>The renovation process took them five months and the homeowner spent nearly $39,000 fixing issues created during the renovation. Then, other clients of Merediths came forwards with similar issues. However, Merediths on 7 January 2022 released an official statement where they addressed the criticism.</p><p>The post read, “We’ve seen stories that have [sic] been circulating, and although we cannot speak for anyone but ourselves, we can say that we have always tried to give everything we have to make anyone we work with happy.” They ended the post, “We ask that these threats and piling on without the full story stop … So many believe that we are frauds, have hurt people intentionally and that we are not who we say we are. That is simply not true”.</p><h3><strong>How Many Kids Does Candis Meredith Have?</strong></h3><p>Candis Meredith shared three sons with her ex-husband.

She also shared that and Andy both worked hard to make the previous relationship work but admitted that there was nothing you could do if two people are truly not compatible.</p><p>But, Candis avoided sharing what part of her marriage was negative.
