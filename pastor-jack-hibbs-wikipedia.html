His Birthday and Early Life</h2><p>Jack Hibbs was born in the year 1958 on January 15. As of 2021, he is 63 years old. He had a troubled childhood as he stuttered while speaking. As a result, Jack had very few friends.</p><p>Jack’s parents had two sons before they gave birth to him. Thus, at one point, they weren’t sure about having a third kid. Consequently, his mother tried to abort the baby, but it somehow failed.</p><p>When Jack was 19 years of age, he attended the local church. There, the faith and power of the lord moved him and changed his life forever.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income Sources</h2><p>As of 2021, Jack Hibb’s net worth is about $5 million. He leads multiple companies in addition to his church and the massive ministry. Furthermore, Jack is also an author of the book ‘Turn around at home,’ which he co-wrote with his wife.</p><p>Moreover, Jack has 320k subscribers in <a href=#>YouTube</a> with millions of viewers each month and 90k followers in <a href=#>Instagram</a> in 2021. This also adds to his wealth and income.</p><h2>Hibbs as COVID Denying Pastor</h2><p>Criticisms have spiraled up against pastor Jack Hibbs for denying the seriousness of the COVID pandemic. Jack thinks that sin is a more significant threat to humanity than a virus we have a 99.96% chance of recovering from.</p><p>In May 2020, he had enough of the two months lockdown and started speaking against it. Furthermore, he even hosted in-person baptism for about a thousand people. It’s evident that the Hibbs was downplaying the seriousness of the COVID pandemic.</p><p>In a sermon, Jack told a little story to his followers. He talked about attending a wedding in the midst of the pandemic without a mask! A lady with a mask intervened and asked him about his safety precautions.</p><p>He replied that we must wear Christ as our savior instead of a mask. Jack further told the lady that sin is 100% more lethal and dangerous than a mere virus.</p><p>Currently, as the death tolls have risen above 300k in the US alone, an influential figure such as Hibbs making irresponsible comments has garnered much attention.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2BMnJylnZKntrW1xKxlnKedZL2iv9OoqWaikZi4brTIm5msZaeeuKq8xJ2gmmc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lee-brice-pancreatic-cancer-research-benefit.html><span>←</span><span>Lee Brice Helps Raise Over $570K for Pancreatic Cancer Research</span></a>
