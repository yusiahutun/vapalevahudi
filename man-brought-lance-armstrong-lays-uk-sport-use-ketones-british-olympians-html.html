Salazar is appealing his ban. He was also part of the investigations that saw American sprinter Marion Jones stripped of her five Olympic medals. Ketones are a synthetic form of a body acid which process energy more efficiently and had been developed for the US military, according to UK Sport documents and the professor behind their development.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>UK Sport had checked with the World Anti-Doping Agency if ketones were on the banned list before proceeding with the experiment and were told that they weren’t, but WADA reserved the right to review that position.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As such, UK Sport produced a ‘participant information sheet’ to accompany their research project which read: ‘UK Sport does not guarantee, promise, assure or represent that use of ketone esters is absolutely World Anti-Doping Code compliant and therefore excludes all responsibility for use of the ketone ester.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>UK Sport also told athletes in the document: ‘WADA might exercise ... their rights to regulate … [and] collect blood samples or retrospectively test old samples. This may occur if there was pressure of the media if the concept was to leak. However … ketosis is a temporary physiological state and would be difficult to prove or test with any post-event samples.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>More than 40 per cent of athletes ended up with side-effects including vomiting and gastrointestinal upsets, and 28 individuals stopped taking it for this reason. The reputation of British Olympic sport has suffered after the revelations in The Mail On Sunday.</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>$10M FUNDING FROM US ARMY</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>They&nbsp;fuelled Team GB’s Olympians at London 2012, but what are ketones?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The use of ketones drinks in professional cycling has been a constant source of speculation since 2012. After all, their biggest potential benefit is seen in endurance events.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ketones are produced naturally by the liver and are understood to provide the body with an energy source that is more efficient than carbohydrate. In states of fuel shortage, like fasting, the body converts fat into ketones in order to meet the energy needs of the brain, which is unable to utilise fat when carbohydrate levels are low. Ketones can provide a rapid and efficient alternative energy supply to the heart and muscles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the 2000s, this energy source was of interest to the US Special Forces who gave $10m to Oxford University to develop an edible form of ketones that could be consumed in a drink for use by soldiers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A UK Sport Board presentation, obtained by The Mail on Sunday, detailed how during a trial involving elite British rowers in 2011 over a 30-minute effort, ketones enhanced performance by one to two per cent — one world record and six personal bests were set.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2011, UK Anti-Doping and the World Anti-Doping Agency both confirmed to UK Sport that ketones were not currently on the prohibited substance list.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/sport/sportsnews/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Newspapers around the world followed up the story. ‘Medals at any price?’ was the question posed by the Swiss media group SFH.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In France, L’Equipe said there was ‘concern about the use of ketones in the 2012 Olympics’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Saarbrucker Zeitung in Germany reported UK Sport being criticised due to a ‘wonder drug’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>On the back of inquiry into physical abuse of British gymnasts, Olympic silver medallist Cath Bishop, former rowing partner of Katherine Grainger, the chair of UK Sport, has called for the UK to change its approach to Olympic sport, citing the damage that focusing only on medals has done.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The MoS story and the ongoing allegations of abuse suffered by British gymnasts are causing sports chiefs to question Team GB’s obsession with medals.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Last week, British Olympic team chief Mark England appeared to cast doubt on UK Sport’s medal-based approach to funding and said: ‘Is it time for that narrative to change to Team GB athletes being role models rather than it just being medal focused? The Olympics stands for something greater than the pursuit of medals, though currently we’re measured in that way.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>UK Sport declined to comment on Tygart’s views but has previously stated they received ethical clearance to proceed with the study from the UK Sport Research Advisory Group and said: ‘UK Sport resolutely refutes any accusation that Olympians were used as “guinea pigs” and finds this allegation misleading and offensive. UK Sport does not fund research projects aimed at giving our national teams a performance advantage at the expense of athlete welfare.’</p><img id=i-3ad6685cdbea59c0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/11/22/30656528-8513525-Great_Britain_won_a_total_of_65_medals_at_the_London_2012_Olympi-a-7_1594503878453.jpg height=422 width=633 alt="Great Britain won a total of 65 medals at the London 2012 Olympics, including 29 golds" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span></span><p class=imageCaption>Great Britain won a total of 65 medals at the London 2012 Olympics, including 29 golds</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/11/22/30657454-0-image-m-50_1594502201382.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>REVEALED: British London 2012 Olympians were used as guinea...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/23/20/31119824-0-image-m-72_1595532641687.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>'The judge said "your thighs are disgusting"': Mimi-Isabella...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/22/16/30843972-0-image-m-6_1595433196069.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Team GB chief insists it's time to end obsession with...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/24/22/31164798-0-image-a-15_1595624472980.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Virtual Olympic Games: Sportsmail tell you how Britain's...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e9Kppquso6OyuL%2BOmqmtoZOhsm6ElG9nam1pZJqiuoybqaitl53BbpjAp5qeZXGnurTA0ailoGWclsa0ebSEZIyon6fBbsHSnmSknaSku6a%2FjHupoqyZqLVum8uypKmhkaPAb7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chase-looney-net-worth-fixer-to-fabulous-salary.html><span>←</span><span>Chase Looney Net Worth: 'Fixer to Fabulous' Salary</span></a>
