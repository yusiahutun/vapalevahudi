We arrived the night prior and stayed the night at the absolutely lovely <a href=#>Hood River Hotel</a> right downtown and smack dab next to the train station. I booked a suite room just in case we needed a bigger room for the kids to play in (we went with another family). The suite had a kitchen and a living/dining room area in addition to the double-bed bedroom. In the dining room, they put a little Victrola record player on a small cabinet with a dozen or so records.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/chriscoyier.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/IMG_1293-scaled.jpeg><p>On the player was the 1967 Rolling Stones compilation record Flowers. It was on the B side, which started with Backstreet Girl. I already knew the song well, as one of my favorite bands, Golden Smog, covered it on their debut album which I‚Äôve listened to a billion times.</p><p>It was wonderful hearing that old song, on an old vinyl record, on an old record player, in an old hotel. It was just a mood and I was there for it.</p><p>I thought I might try to recreate the sound just for fun.</p><li>Buy the song from the <a href=#>iTunes Store</a>. $1.29 ‚Äî no DRM. Download it.</li><li>Found <a href=#>Dust ‚Äòn Scratches</a>, a vinyl noise ‚Äúgenerator‚Äù, and give them a few bucks to download a custom vinyl noise.</li><li>Drag both tracks on top of one another in Screenflow. Adjust levels so it sounds about right.</li><li>Export as AIFF. Convert to MP3. Put in audio element.</li><p>Here are two minutes of that, just truncated so maybe I don‚Äôt get in trouble?</p><figure class=wp-block-audio></figure><p>Doesn‚Äôt quite capture the mood but I was just smurfing around anyway.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=article-end>ü§ò</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibmKe2tK%2FOsqCeql6jsrV7kWlpa2dhZ3xzg46ipWavmJ6wqXnIZqursV2pvG6%2BxJypnpmkmnq1tMRmraKalWK8p3nBmpqkq6SnsqbAjKCgq6RdlsBuvMuasJ6cXaS7bq2MqKOdZaaeu7q4jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./3-alternatives-to-the-now-defunct-truecrypt-for-your-encryption-needs.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>3 Alternatives to the Now-Defunct TrueCrypt for Your Encryption Needs</span></a>
