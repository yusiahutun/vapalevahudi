Without delay, she would send a draft of what she had just written to good friend Serena Jin Sheng Hwa, who is emeritus professor of translation at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. “I’d only retire to bed in peace after hearing her comments on my writing,” she writes.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here are some highlights from Jing Qian Jing Hou that shed light on Lin’s private life:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/27/2508bb90-2eca-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_152127.JPG><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/27/002af8fe-2ec7-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_152127.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">On her friendship with designer William Chang Suk-ping</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chang designed her looks in many films, including All the Wrong Spies (1983) and Ashes of Time (1994). Lin describes him as her closest male friend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“All the big movie stars and big beauties love him. But, very sorry, I am his biggest love … For the movies I made in Hong Kong, 90 per cent of my looks in the films were designed by him. He also designed my three books … He also renovated my house in Hong Kong after I got married at the age of 39,” she writes in the book.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She recalls an incident when they were young which scared Chang away. “Suk-ping came to visit me in my small apartment [in Kowloon]. I suddenly thought of the three Polaroid pictures I took and gave them for him to see … [later] I went inside the bedroom to get on my white bathing robe … when I came out, he said he wanted to leave which puzzled me … 30 years later … I asked him why he suddenly left that day … he said the pictures I showed him three decades ago were stark-naked pictures of myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/27/260d0406-2eca-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_152127.JPG><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/27/63c5058a-2ec7-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_152127.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">On her friendship with former power couple Tsui Hark and Nansun Shi</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lin met Shi during the filming of The Legend of the Swordsman II (1992), which was produced by Tsui.

It was just 10 days [after] we met up. From extreme brightness to extreme misery, her life was like a meteor flitting across the sky into darkness … I mourn for her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/11/27/268d15b0-2eca-11eb-be20-200ca6256645_972x_152127.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">On her road to fame and regret of not having a university education</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After making her big screen debut Outside the Window (1973), Lin was indecisive about her future path.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wasn’t academically gifted and couldn’t get into university.
