If first impressions count then it can be the trigger for good grades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a hobby, you can <a href=#>start with handwriting practice</a> and move on to calligraphy. And yes, once you get up for the paper and pen, you can do it from the cushions.</p><p>The 12 keys in this course will show you how. Each key comes with specially designed practice pages. As you go through the keys, you will spot the flaws in your method and the means to correct them.</p><p>This short course isn't just meant for children with handwriting difficulties but for anyone who wants to express their individuality through writing.</p><h2 id=dan-rather-on-journalism-amp-finding-the-truth-in-the-news-no-longer-available>2.

Reading the news (or even watching it) is a habit and can also be a hobby that makes you more world aware and smart. But if you haven't been hibernating then you should be aware that <a href=#>"fake news"</a> is in the dictionary now.</p><p>Dan Rather has an antidote. This critical thinking education is a must for our data addled times. The core of the course takes you inside the world of 21st Century journalism. This gives you an insight into how news is generated and marketed.</p><p>The short course from a respected journalist will make you a more informed consumer and maybe, a proactive citizen journalist.</p><h2 id=genealogy-learn-to-climb-the-branches-of-your-family-tree>3. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Genealogy: Learn to Climb the Branches of Your Family Tree</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Genealogy.jpg><p><strong>Total students enrolled:</strong> 120</p><p><strong>Course length:</strong> 4 hours</p><p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Learn how to chart your own family tree.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2012 article, <a href=#>ABC News</a> said that genealogy was the second most popular hobby in the US. Digitization has helped to make it an armchair activity though you would do better if you hit the road too. <a href=#>Free genealogy websites</a> on one end and cheaper DNA tests on the other are doing their bit too. Maybe, this course will make you trace your own roots.</p><p>The short course will teach you the basic tools to start your own research with a methodical plan. The scientific research methods you learn here and practice will also help you in any other investigative project later.</p><p>For instance, the skills of conducting interviews and notetaking are valuable in other areas of study too.</p><h2 id=mental-math-tricks-to-become-a-human-calculator>4. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Mental Math Tricks to Become a Human Calculator</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mental-Math.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Total students enrolled:</strong> 10,788</p><p><strong>Course length:</strong> 2 hours</p><p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> Learn how to do speed math without the aid of a calculator.</p><p>You carry a calculator in your pocket. It's called a mobile phone. Even Siri and Google Assistant are at your command. But nothing beats the ability to crunch numbers in your head and spit them out in a few seconds. Yes, mental math can be a hobby if you love working with numbers or even Sudoku.</p><p>But the biggest benefit? It will keep your brain sharp and <a href=#>kill the fear of numbers</a>, formulas, spreadsheets, and math games.</p><p>High-speed Vedic maths has its own tricks that help it overtake conventional mathematical methods for calculations on the fly. Don't worry, it's not advanced mathematics. Just a better way to add, subtract, divide, and multiply numbers without reaching for a paper.</p><p>The only requirement is that you should at least know the tables from 1x1 to 9x9. After that, you just have to unlearn some of the old ways of number juggling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=school-of-origami-learn-how-to-fold-and-master-origami>5. <a rel=nofollow href=#>School of Origami: Learn How to Fold and Master Origami</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Origami.jpg><p><strong>Total students enrolled:</strong> 934</p><p><strong>Course length:</strong> 3.5 hours</p><p><strong>Key lesson:</strong> How to turn paper into beautiful 3D objects.</p><p>Your origami hobby can grow into something big.
