As the <a href=#>North Node of </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny</a> joins forces with Chiron—the wounded healer—in your ninth house of wisdom and expansion on February 19, you will begin to process the losses that have taken place and use them to learn more about the meaning of life. Not only are you rediscovering that knowledge is power, but you’re also learning how to hack your mindset and embrace a much more positive understanding. When a lunar eclipse in Libra lands in your third house of siblings, close friends, and daily communications as of March 25, a series of life-changing conversations could take place as your social circle begins to evolve and dissolve. And as a total solar eclipse casts a shadow over your ninth house of perspective on April 8, you may find yourself letting go of one set of beliefs in favor of another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/venusinleoaffecteachzodiac.png><p>One of the most exciting moments for you in the course of 2024 arrives on April 20.

You may rediscover your goals from a new angle, break the internet with a meaningful press release, or simply take on the job of your dreams. Either way, you’re making waves in your field. And once Jupiter enters your 11th house of social outreach and global impact on May 25, you may find yourself meeting tons of new people for the rest of the year; people who will have so much to teach you, show you, and give you. It’s all about who you know!</p><p>By the time a lunar eclipse in Pisces sets off alarms in your eighth house of death and rebirth on September 17, you may uncover life-altering information that sparks a transformation. Secrets will be revealed, alliances will shift, and the level of trust you are able to give and receive will be challenged. This is soon to be followed by a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>solar eclipse in Libra</a> on October 2, jumpstarting the engine in your third house of communication and and information, furthering your pursuit for knowledge and activating your desire to study.</p><p>However, as the year comes to a close, you may be forced to rethink the way you express yourself, judge yourself, and monitor your ego.
