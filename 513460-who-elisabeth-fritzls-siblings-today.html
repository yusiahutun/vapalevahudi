Here is more information about Elisabeth Fritzl's siblings.</p><h3>1. Ulrike Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Born in 1957, Ulrike is the eldest of Elisabeth Fritzl's sisters. Before Elisabeth's disappearance, the two had a great relationship.</p><p class=align-left>But unlike Elisabeth, Ulrike got excellent treatment from her dad as a young girl. She had the luxury of going <a href=#>on vacations</a> in Italy and more. Currently, Ulrike Pramesberger is a teacher and is also married. She resides with her family in Bad Goisern at the Alp's foot.</p><h3>2. Rosemarie Jnr Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Rosemarie Jnr Fritzl, named after her mother, was born in 1960 in Amstetten, Austria. The nature of her relationship with her younger sister, Elisabeth, isn't known. Also, there's no information about her <a href=#>education</a> and family, i.e. husband and children.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c0df02234c6502aa.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Clip of Karen Nyamu and Samidoh at Son's School Emerges after Online Spat with Sue Gacambi</span></p></a><h3>3. Harald Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Harald Fritzl born in 1963 is the eldest son of Josef and Rosemarie Fritzl. Like his other siblings, Harald lives a very private life, so there’s no information about his whereabouts.</p><p class=align-left>During his father's trial, he revealed that he and his siblings were raised under the abusive influence of Josef Fritzl. He explicitly narrated how he was physically assaulted by his father severally.</p><h3>4. Gabrielle Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Gabrielle Fritzl was born in 1971 and has a twin brother. He was 13 years old when her elder sister, Elisabeth, disappeared. Gabrielle lived most of her life believing that her sister had joined a secret sect and abandoned her children. Today, Gabrielle lives with her child and husband, Juergen Helm, near Amstetten.</p><h3>5. Josef Jr.</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e49937b438515dec.jpg><p class=align-left>Josef Jr., born in 1971, is the twin brother of Gabrielle Fritzl. He was named after his father, Josef Fritzl. During Elisabeth's liberation, he lived with his parents in Ybsstrasse, Amsterdam. But after the case, he kept away from the spotlight, meaning there's no information about his current life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/06d3c98c30b2b755.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where are Elisabeth Fritzl's children today? All the details</span></p></a><h3>6. Doris Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Doris Fritzl, born in 1972, is the youngest child of Rosemarie and Josef. She was 12 years old when her sister, Elisabeth, was made captive by her dad. Like her other siblings, she's private and hasn't granted the media much audience.</p><p class=align-left>After the revelations of her dad's cruelty, Doris changed her name to Heniki to avoid publicity. Today, she's happily married, but there's no information about her husband and kids.</p><h2>Elizabeth Fritzl's other sibling; her children with Josef Fritzl</h2><p class=align-left>Before the 2008 revelation, people knew Josef as a genial father of seven. Everyone, including his wife and children, was astonished when they discovered he had other children with her daughter Elisabeth.</p><p class=align-left>Josef kidnapped and imprisoned her daughter in their basement and continuously tortured her for 24 years. So, here are Elizabeth's other siblings/ children that resulted from the ordeal.</p><h3>1. Kerstin Fritzl</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/97aa2247a0ca58ce.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rudy Farias: Man Who Went Missing 8 Years Ago as Teenager Found Living with Mother</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kerstin Fritzl was born on 30th August 1988. She spent 19 years in the cellar and first saw the outside <a href=#>world</a> when Josef took her to the hospital. <a href=#>The hospital</a> staff was surprised to see her malnourished and missing half of her dental formula. They alerted the police, leading to Elisabeth's release and Josef Fritzl's arrest.</p><h3>2. Stefan Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Stefan Fritzl, born on 1st February 1990, was the second child and 8th sibling of Elizabeth Fritzl. He was raised in the basement alongside Kerstin Fritzl and one other kid. Stefan Fritzl didn't attend school and walked with a slight slope because of living in a cellar for a long time.</p><p class=align-left>After being released from the cellar, he was cared for in a nearby clinic. Today Stefan Fritzl lives in a two-storey family home with her other siblings.</p><h3>3. Lisa Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Lisa Fritzl was born on 29th August 1992 and is one of Elisabeth's upstairs children. Elizabeth's parents, Josef and Rosemarie, raised her in the main <a href=#>family house</a>. Lisa Fritzl had a normal life – she attended school, which she described as fun. She lives with her mother and five other siblings in their heavily protected home in Hamlet, Austria.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8ab0b6e88f13b8ce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rongai Dad Whose 2 Kids Were Allegedly Stabbed by Mum Marks Birthday Days after Burying Them</span></p></a><h3>4. Monika Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Born on 26th February 1994, Monika is the other upstairs child. Her grandmother Rosemarie and father/ grandfather Josef Fritzl brought her up. Her childhood was normal – she went to school, got excellent medical care and made friends. Today she lives with her family, i.e. her mother and five other siblings.</p><h3>5. Alexander Fritzl</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c0df02234c6502aa.png><p class=align-left>Alexander Fritzl, born on 28th April 1996, is the 3rd Elisabeth's upstairs child. Like Lisa Fritzl and Monika Fritzl, he had a reasonably normal life which certainly changed after the 2008 Fritzl case. Right now, Alexander Fritzl lives with his family in their protected home.</p><h3>6. Michael Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Michael Fritzl, born on 28th August 1996, was Alexander's twin. Sadly, Michael Fritzl died three days after his birth. It's speculated that the cause of his death was a complication due to inbreeding. Joseph disposed of her son's/ grandchild's body in the furnace that warmed the cellar.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d1a896e5156c09ac.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jay-Z's Mum Gloria Carter Weds Longtime Female Lover Roxanne in Lavish, Star-Studded Wedding</span></p></a><h3>7. Felix Fritzl</h3><p class=align-left>Felix Fritzl, born on 16th December 2002, is the youngest of Elisabeth's Children. His first six years of captivity in the basement surely affected him. After their release, Felix Fritzl preferred crawling to walking and clung tightly to her mother. Today, he lives with his mother and other siblings in their protected two-storey home.</p><h2>Does Elisabeth Fritzl talk to her siblings?</h2><p class=align-left>Yes, Elizabeth Fritzl is in contact with her siblings, but they keep their interactions a secret. Elizabeth has a new identity today and lives in a secret Austrian village. Her home, where she lives with her children, is under 24/7 CCTV surveillance, and the police constantly survey the area. Plus, the family doesn't do interviews.</p><p class=align-left>Though she is now in her late 50s, there isn't any latest picture of her. Her last photo was taken when she was 16 years. Her new identity has concealed her past, which has helped ensure her immortality as the beautiful girl held captive for 24 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/668c97964f2f276d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Juliani, Lillian Nganga and Son Spend Weekend at Safaricom Jazz, Share Lovely Video</span></p></a><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p class=align-left>Before the Fritzl case in 2008, people didn’t know much about the Fritzl family. But after the revelations of Elisabeth Fritzl's kidnap and torture by her dad from their home's cellar for 24 years, people immediately became interested in the family. They wanted to know Elisabeth Fritzl's siblings, her mother etc. and whether they were okay or had also been abused by their beast of a dad.</p><p class=align-left>Tuko.co.ke has shared an article on <a href=#>where is Elisabeth Fritzl now</a>. <a href=#>Elisabeth Fritzl</a> emerged from complete anonymity and isolation to become one of the most famous people across the globe. Elisabeth spent 24 years of her life locked up in their home's cellar by her father, Josef Fritzl. While in the basement, Elisabeth endured almost daily torture from her father and gave birth to seven children.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnCywJyrrGWcnrOmtMCcoqxnk5q5pq7RoquyZZKevKi%2BwKmfop2jZIJyf5NvZ2avmKR6prjIrJibnaSdeqe%2ByK2xpatdqLajuMinnqxlpKSxosWO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tracy-spiridakos-and-jon-cor.html><span>←</span><span>Tracy Spiridakos and Jon Cor</span></a>
