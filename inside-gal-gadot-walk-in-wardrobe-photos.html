Everyone from star <a class=hm-link href=#>Susanna Reid</a> to <a class=hm-link href=#>Ronan Keating</a> have decided to stay within the safety of their homes while the pandemic continues, and Gal Gadot is the latest to share her decision. "Staying home is my super power," she said on Instagram. "And yours! Please everyone take care of yourself, your loved ones and us all. This situation should not be taken lightly. The sooner we all stay home and keep ourselves from catching this very contagious virus, the sooner we can go back to our lives without losing lives #WeAreAllOne."</p><p id=e38ZS0-tM8tN data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>18 celebrity wardrobes and glam rooms that have to be seen to be believed</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6663737c6c33-gal-gadot-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=enPAvjsu-epj data-wc=9><strong>Gal Gadot revealed a look at her walk-in wardrobe</strong></p><p id=eHK3yO_UVKbz data-wc=78>Besides her announcement, Gal's post also gave us a look at her walk-in wardrobe for the first time, and it is every bit as impressive as you'd expect. It looks as though it's formed of two rooms with wardrobes, drawers and shelves lining every wall, and a wall of full-length mirrors in which Gal took her selfie. The back room also looks a little more organised than the one she stands in, with colour coordinated T-shirts and trousers.</p><p id=epoz3kemu5t_ data-wc=1><strong>SEE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's mind-blowing mansion</a></strong></p><p id=erXvrIxGn3hm data-wc=43>As for the décor, Gal's walk-in wardrobe features a muted colour scheme with beige walls and cupboards and wooden floors with a beige rug. In fact, a neutral walk-in wardrobe seems to be the go-to for most celebrities: <a class=hm-link href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Ferne McCann</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Jenna Dewan</a> all have one.</p><p id=ess9nyLaecLe data-wc=80>Gal had&nbsp;been working on Dwayne Johnson's Netflix movie before her decision to stay home,&nbsp;but&nbsp;production has been suspended due to the coronavirus. Dwayne said: "We really appreciate all your hard work and your patience during this time, but you know my number one goal for you guys – and it's our number one goal too – is that we're gonna get everybody home to their families. Because really that's where they need to be right now."</p><p id=e-3RpTlQhcqk data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
