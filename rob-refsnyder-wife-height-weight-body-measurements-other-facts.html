The couple who had the pleasure of adopting young Rob; Jane and Clint Refsnyder live in California but are of German and Irish descent respectively. With the Refsnyders, he had an idyllic childhood and received his high school education at Laguna Hills High School, where he joined the baseball team. He had always been a fan of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He also played basketball and was a wide back receiver and outside linebacker for the school’s baseball team. At graduation, he was named offensive player of the year in football and most valuable player in baseball, and as expected, colleges came to him.</p><p>As a college, he chose the University of Arizona, where he chose to play baseball with the Arizona Wildcats. In his first year, he received the All-Pacific-10 Honorable Mention, and in his junior year in the 2012 season, Rob beat .352 and took the lead with 6 home runs, 63 beaten runs, and 12 stolen bases. After his good form in the 2012 College World Series, he was named the most outstanding player after the Wildcats beat the South Carolina Gamecocks with his performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rob-Refsnyder.jpg><h2><strong>Professional Career</strong></h2><p>Rob Refsnyder began his professional career with the New York Yankees, who named him as the second baseman for the 2012 MBL draft as the 187th. Under the terms of the contract, he received a signing bonus of $205,900. He made his first appearance on July 10 at the Charleston Riverdogs, the South Atlantic Class A league, which is a partner of the Yankees. After a stellar 13-game performance in the 2013 season in Charleston, he was called up to the Tampa Yankees in the Class A-Advanced Florida State League, where he played 117 games, hit .283, and scored 6 home runs.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Carla Esparza Height, Weight, Body Measurements, Family, Biography</a></strong></p><p>For the 2014 season, he switched back to Trenton Thunder, where beating coach Marcus Thomas taught him a new swing style that doesn’t require too much movement and thus reduces stress. This in turn led to an enormous improvement in his performance and earned him the Eastern League’s “Player of the Week” award. In his next round of play, he proved defense on second base and worked on his promotion opportunities at various levels until he was given the chance to fight for a place and promotion to the big leagues in 2015. Rob Refsnyder accepted the challenge and played 81 games for the Scranton/Wilkes Barre, beat .290, scored 7 home runs, 17 doubles, and 37 RBIs, which certainly earned him a place in the big leagues.</p><p>With his promotion to the big leagues, Rob Refsnyder became the fourth-ranked player behind Hee-seop Choi, Shin-Soo Choo, and Jung-ho Kang, who was born in South Korea. Between July and November 2017, the promoted player was transferred twice; first to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for Ryan McBroom and then to the Cleveland Indians, where he has remained to this day.</p><h2><strong>Rob Refsnyder Wife</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Rob-Refsnyder-Wife.jpg><p>Rob found love at the University of Arizona, where he met his wife Monica in 2012 while they were students at the institution.
