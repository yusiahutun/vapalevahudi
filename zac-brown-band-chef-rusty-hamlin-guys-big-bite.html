Chef Rusty got his start there prior to linking up with the Zac Brown Band as their full-time executive chef, which has him on the road over 200 days a year.</p><p>Fans who have been fortunate enough to experience the Zac Brown Band's extravagant eat-n-greets on the road can now purchase some of Brown's signature cooking items used for the feast. Brown has made his special Georgia Clay Rub and Southern Ground Grub Brown Sauce available on the road as well as through the band's official <a href=#>website</a>. Items can be purchased individually or in <a href=#>special bundles</a>, some of which include their Southern Ground Cookbook.</p><p>If you missed Hamlin's appearance on 'Guy's Big Bite,' you can still get a taste of it by trying out the recipe below.</p><p><strong>Pretzel Beer Brittle Recipe</strong></p><p><strong></strong>1 Stout beer<br>3 cups granulated sugar<br>vanilla extract<br>3 tablespoons light corn syrup<br>broken pretzels<br>peanuts</p><p>Dissolve the sugar and beer in a small saucepan. Add in vanilla and corn syrup. Bring to a light boil until the temperature reaches 305 degrees. Spread broken pretzels and peanuts over a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Carefully pour mixture over broken pretzels and peanuts. Set aside until cool and completely hardened. Break brittle with fingers and serve.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZms5mTYq%2Bzu9anZJuZnpl6pLTEn2SrraOpxm60wKajoqZdnMK6v4yboKBlkp7Bpns%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./diego-dreyfus.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Diego Dreyfus dating?
