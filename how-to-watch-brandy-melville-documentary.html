If you’re wondering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how to watch the Brandy Melville documentary</a> to go behind the scenes on discriminatory work practices and fast fashion, we’ve got the 4-1-1 on how to stream it online.</p><p>Brandy Hellville & The Cult of Fast Fashion documentary is directed by Academy Award-winning filmmaker Eva Orner and produced by double Emmy Award-winning Jonathan Chinn and double Academy Award-winning Simon Chinn of Lightbox. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Brandy Melville</a> documentary releases on Tuesday, April 9, 2024 and will let viewers in on how the nostalgic clothing brand’s unique social media presence set off unrealistic beauty standards. Through interviews with former employees and executives as well as fashion insiders, viewers will get to hear first-hand accounts about Brandy Melville’s toxic work environment and discriminatory recruiting practices, too.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>Behind the “one size fits most” clothes and impossible-to-reach beauty standards created on social media, there’s a whole story of exploitation within fast fashion and the fashion industry at large. More specifically, viewers will get to learn about the consequences of the increase in consumption and production of cheap clothing. The documentary takes the audience to Ghana to see the mass amounts of textile waste that’s polluting landfills and waters.
