The show allows fans and followers to receive advice from their favorite silver screen stars. The first episode aired on July 13 and it featured two celebrity couples — 'The Real Housewives of Orange County' star Heather with husband Terry Dubrow and Akbar Gbaja-Biamila with Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez. The celebrity guests donned their headsets and answered many questions related to family, relationships, friends and work. Right from parenting to cheating boyfriends, the celebrities tapped their own experiences and funny anecdotes to help callers through their situations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/6a66d23a-bd04-4d01-b1b6-6d41ed26cd9d.jpg><p>Terry and Heather Dubrow met through a friend on a blind date in the 1990s and got married in 1999. The couple has four children: twins Nicholas and Mixmillia, as well as daughters Katarina and Collette. Even after being together for years, they never shy away from showering each other with love. The 'power couple' has been married for 21 years now. But do you know how much the celebrity couple is actually worth?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Terry Dubrow's wealth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/bc437c1a-fb9e-496f-887b-f6d499f8ea97.jpg><p>As reported by Celebrity Net Worth, Dr Dubrow first started making waves when he was a resident at UCLA School of Medicine, becoming the chief resident of general and plastic surgery. After that, he started his own practice. He is a renowned surgeon working extensively out of his office in Newport Beach in California.</p><p>In 2004, Terry starred in FOX's popular reality show 'The Swan'. And then, in 2014, Terry signed the hit E! reality show 'Botched' which focused on correcting plastic surgeries that went wrong. The show has surely made Terry busier and wealthier in the following years.</p><p>After appearing in 'The Real Housewives of Orange County' with wife Heather, he got more notoriety and fame which paved the way for the popular TV show 'Botched' in 2014. In an interview with Reality Tea, Dr Dubrow said that Botched has helped him and Dr Nassif become better surgeons. "We, surprisingly even to ourselves, have been able to take patients that even we thought were unfixable... We've figured out ways to fix them, and we now have a different level, a different standard than we're comparing our results to so sometimes," he explained.</p><p>Terry is the third richest plastic surgeon in the world. In an interview with Female First, when asked about his "camera surrounded" life, he said, "Yeah I don’t even think about it. I was thinking about this yesterday – I have actually done eight reality shows now, dating back to 2003 when we did The Swan. I am so used to having cameras in the house, in the office and in the operating room that I don’t even register that they are there anymore,"</p><p>Dubrow has also co-authored three books titled 'Dr. and Mrs. Guinea Pig Present the Only Guide You'll Ever Need to the Best Anti-Aging Treatments', 'The Dubrow Diet: Interval Eating to Lose Weight and Feel Ageless', The Dubrow Keto Fusion Diet' with his wife Heather, and 'The Acne Cure' with Brenda Adderly.&nbsp;</p><p>Dubrow also owns a skincare line called Consult Beaute. In an interview with Market Wired, the Botched star said, "While plastic surgery isn't for everyone, every woman deserves to feel beautiful. I'm an advocate for minimal treatment that helps produce natural-looking results. I believe Consult Beaute's innovative approach to anti-aging will help enhance the natural beauty and look of vitality customers are in search of without surgery."</p><p>In 2013, Dubrows sold their Orange County mansion for a reported $16.4M and purchased land in a new community to build their dream home. Celebrity Net Worth puts Dr Dubrow's current net worth at $50 million.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Heather Dubrow's wealth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/b841410d-532f-4a1d-9449-b013aa99b865.jpg><p>Heather has appeared in CBS drama 'That's Life'.
