<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Lacey Fletcher Died on Her Parent's Couch: What Happened?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>In 2022, a story broke across media outlets in the US. The report was so gruesome and tragic that it gained media traction and spread internationally. This story was about a Louisiana woman, Lacey Fletcher. While the story shook the entire world to its core, it didn’t take long before the feeling of shock turned to anger.&nbsp;</p><p>Lacey was an American woman who suffered from crippling social anxiety, locked-in syndrome, and autism. She gained media attention after authorities found her dead at her parent’s home in Louisiana, lying on a couch. Since the story broke, the world has been curious about who the deceased woman is and what happened to her.</p><p>Here’s everything we know about Lacey Fletcher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-12_06-17-46-fotor-2023071261856.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lacey_Fletcher></span>Who Is Lacey Fletcher?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although there are no details about her, we know that her life began in Slaughter, Louisiana. Lacey Fletcher was the only child of her parents, Sheila and Clay Fletcher. Although her birth date is unknown, online reports suggest she passed away at 36. Lacey’s parents were church-going pillars of the community. Hence, she grew up in a Christian home.&nbsp;</p><p>The Fletchers reportedly moved into their Slaughter home over two decades back. Lacey attended the Brownsville Baptist Academy in Louisiana, where she played volleyball for the school’s team. However, her life derailed after ninth grade, the last time her friends saw her.</p><p>According to a neighbor of the family, Robert Blades, Lacey was a normal kid who enjoyed playing outside with the other neighborhood kids. However, she started isolating herself from the other kids when she was 14.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Happened_to_the_Louisiana_Woman_on_the_Couch></span>What Happened to the Louisiana Woman on the Couch?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After ninth grade, Lacey Fletcher developed some degree of Asperger’s syndrome. In addition, she was also diagnosed with autism and crippling social anxiety. She had locked-in syndrome,&nbsp;a rare neurological disorder that happens when a part of the brainstem is damaged and causes paralysis.</p><p>Due to her medical condition, Lacey’s parents became her caregivers, and she spent most of her life at home. Following her death, the East Feliciana Parish Coroner, Dr. Ewell Dewitt Bickham, described the scene as ‘sickening.’ He also revealed that Lacey died from severe medical neglect, which led to chronic malnutrition, acute starvation, immobility, acute ulcer formation, and osteomyelitis, a bone infection that led to sepsis.</p><p>In addition, District Attorney Sam D’Aquilla insists that Lacey’s parents, who were also her caregivers, neglected her and treated her inhumanely. Aside from this, online reports also suggest that her parents left her to relieve herself on the couch while they were away without food or care.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Found_Lacey></span>Who Found Lacey?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lacey Fletcher’s parents, who claimed to have just returned from a weekend vacation, found her body. On January 3, 2022, her mom, Sheila, called 911 to report that their daughter wasn’t breathing. After giving the dispatcher her address, cops arrived at their Slaughter home in Louisiana, and nothing prepared them for the gory sight.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-12_06-17-52-fotor-2023071261938-862x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Was_Lacey_Fletcher_Found></span>How Was Lacey Fletcher Found?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Upon entering the home, the first responders knew something was off. Although the residence appeared overly neat, there was an overpowering smell of urine and feces. As they approached the couch, where Lacey lay lifeless, they were horrified to see the state of her body. Her partially naked body was sitting upright, melted, and sunken into a hole worn in the couch’s upholstery.</p><p>Lacey’s body was ravaged by insect bites, sores, and ulcers on her skin that rotted through the bone. Her face had large red blotches and <a href=#>feces</a> all over her face, body, hair, and ears. In addition, maggots were crawling all over her remains that had fused to the couch after spending so much time in the same position.&nbsp;</p><p>The sight made the responders sick to their stomachs, and they called in the local coroner, Dr. Bickham. After examining the body, Dr. Bickham revealed that Lacey’s body weighed just 96 pounds at the time of her death. He added that Lacey had been on the couch suffering for over twelve agonizing years without medical treatment, and her body tested positive for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lacey_Fletcher_Case></span>Lacey Fletcher Case<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Immediately after the coroner ruled a homicide, District Attorney Sam D’Aquilla charged Lacey’s parents with second-degree murder. The evidence presented to the grand jury includes images of Lacey Fletcher’s living conditions and physical state. The pictures were so revolting that medical personnel were available on standby as the photographs got admitted in court.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-12_06-17-58.jpg><p>Despite the public anger, the Judge released Lacey’s parents on a $300,000 bond each. However, weeks before the trial in June 2023, District Judge Kathryn Jones dropped the charges of murder against Lacey’s parents, Clay and Sheila. She cited a technicality in the wording of the indictment for dropping the charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the Judge dropped the charges, D’Aquilla has revealed plans to bring the case back before a different grand jury. He hopes to have the parents of Lacey Fletcher arrested on new charges and bring the case to trial by the end of the year.</p><p>Another case that shook the world to its core is that of <a href=#>Lindsay Nichols</a>, who died after her ex murdered her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuaKvxLJkn6SVqbCpsdFmm6KdlGK8r3nHnqlmqJGnsq%2FA0maaqK2TnXq4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tomoya-kanki.html><span>←</span><span>Tomoya Kanki</span></a>
