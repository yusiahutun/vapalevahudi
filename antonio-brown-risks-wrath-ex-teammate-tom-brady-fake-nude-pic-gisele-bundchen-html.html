Ex-NFL receiver Brown, a former teammate and friend of Brady, uploaded a photo of a topless woman with Bundchen's face clearly edited onto it.
He didn't caption the picture and it was deleted soon after.
The strange post is Brown's latest move in his ongoing spat with Brady, who rarely addresses the feud."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
