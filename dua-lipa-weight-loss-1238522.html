She has a unique singing style, and her vocals are very powerful. Dua Lipa always ensures she creates a powerful stage presence that leaves her audience asking for more. However, the lockdown fell heavy on her as well. She admitted to gaining approximately 16 pounds of weight which was not ready to come off. But, the New Rules singer did not give up and was back in shape before her live performance. Read on to learn about the Dua Lipa weight loss journey and the diet plan she follows to stay in great shape.</p><h2 id=65ae48274028d><strong>Who is Dua Lipa?</strong></h2><p>Dua Lipa is a British singer. She is also a songwriter and model. Dua was born in London in 1995 and celebrated her birthday on August 22. Lipa's father, singer Dukagjin Lipa, was her idol, and she grew up with his songs. Her name means "love" in Albanian. But she was not very fond of it initially. She gradually liked her name and did not change it to enter the industry. She began her music career at 14. Dua took to YouTube and sang songs by other artists. Warner Music Group signed her in 2015, and she released her first single soon after.</p><p>In December 2016, a documentary about Lipa was commissioned by The Fader magazine, titled See in Blue. She gained international fame with her debut self-titled studio album, "Dua Lipa," released in 2017. The album churned out several hit singles, including "New Rules," "IDGAF," and "Be the One," and earned her critical acclaim and commercial success.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Her music style is a blend of pop and dance. Having the Dua Lipa body is a dream for every girl. She is also known for her powerful vocals. She also has a captivating and charismatic stage presence. Dua Lipa has received numerous awards and accolades, including Grammy Awards and Brit Awards, and has become one of her generation's most prominent and successful pop artists.</p><h2 id=65ae48274029f><strong>Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss Journey</strong></h2><p>Dua Lipa is one celebrity who looks fabulous any time of the day. But, she, too, gained weight during the lockdown and admits to having binged on food. The "Levitating "singer admits to losing 15 odd pounds before a live performance to look in shape and captivate the audience with her charm. She had to wear a two-piece for the event, and the silhouette had no extra flab. She keeps active and follows a strict diet plan to ensure she does not gain weight post her performance. For Dua Lipa, height and weight corporations have always been perfect.</p><h2 id=65ae4827402a4><strong>Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/diet/side-effects-of-sea-moss-1229915","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","Diet","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'>Diet</a></strong><a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://www.pinkvilla.com/health/diet/side-effects-of-sea-moss-1229915","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522"," Plan","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><strong> Plan</strong></a></h2><p>It's commendable that for Dua Lipa, weight loss is synonymous with a balance in her diet, allowing herself occasional indulgences while primarily focusing on healthy foods like whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and salads. This approach to nutrition can be sustainable and effective in maintaining overall health and well-being.</p><p>As for her skin, staying hydrated is crucial, and it's a well-known fact that proper hydration contributes to healthy and radiant skin. Drinking water throughout the day keeps the skin moisturized and glowing.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Dua Lipa didn't follow a strict diet regimen but made positive changes to her eating habits, it's essential to note that what works for one person might not work for another. Everyone's body is different, and individual dietary needs and preferences vary.</p><p>She does not believe in crash diets, and she loves her Albanian food and likes going back to a hearty meal after a busy day of work. Instead, she focuses on creating a balanced and sustainable diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods, adequate hydration, and portion control. Combine this with regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle. Together you can achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Remember, the goal should always be overall well-being and health, not just weight loss for aesthetic purposes. If you look at some Dua Lipa before and after pics, there is not much difference except for tonner abs and a leaner look.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2 id=65ae4827402af><strong>Is Eating Whole Foods Better Than Cooking Them?</strong></h2><p>Eating whole foods is generally healthier than highly processed or heavily cooked foods. The benefits include nutrient retention, fiber content, and low sugar and sodium content (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1525/ahu.2000.25.2.120","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","1","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>1</u></a>).</p><h3 id=65ae4827402b6><strong>What Are Positive Eating Habits?</strong></h3><p>Positive eating habits are healthy and sustainable behaviors related to food choices, meal patterns, and overall eating practices that contribute to improved well-being and health. Positive eating habits can lead to better nutrition, weight management, and increased energy levels. By following such habits, you have balanced meals. You can even practice portion control and have a regular meal pattern (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mar.21021","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","2","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>2</u></a>). Even the Dua Lipa weight loss regime had this practice at its core.</p><h3 id=65ae4827403e5><strong>How Does Portion Control Work in Weight Loss?</strong></h3><p>Portion control is crucial for weight loss by helping to manage caloric intake and create a calorie deficit. It is essential for losing weight. When you consume controlled calories, it starts using stored fat for energy. The process leads to weight loss over time. By controlling portion size, you reduce calorie intake and spread awareness of serving sizes (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mar.21021","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","2","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>2</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>Staying Hydrated: The Key to Healthy Skin</strong></h3><p>Staying hydrated is indeed essential for maintaining healthy skin. Our skin is the body's largest organ and requires proper hydration to function optimally. Water helps remove excess toxins from the system and moistens the epithelial tissue. It also regulates the body's temperature and maintains its elasticity (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA10590057&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=08881375&p=HRCA&sw=w&userGroupName=anon%7Ea349e7eb&aty=open-web-entry%5C","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","3","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>3</u></a>).</p><h2><strong>Dua Lipa’s Workout Routine</strong></h2><p>It's great to hear that Dua Lipa maintains a healthy and diverse exercise routine to stay flexible, toned, and in a positive mood. Yoga seems essential to her daily routine, providing her with a warm-up and helping her stay flexible. Thirty minutes of full-body exercise is a good way to warm up and burn calories before more intense workouts. A classic Dua Lipa fitness routine has a mix of everything that can burn calories.</p><p>Boxing appears to be another favorite exercise of the Dua Lipa weight loss manual. It serves not only as a physical activity but also as a way to combat negative moods. Boxing can be a great way to release stress and tension. This exercise is an excellent choice for physical and mental well-being.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Keeping a diverse routine is crucial to staying motivated and interested in working out. Our contributor Dr. Allen Conrad, Doctor of Chiropractic at Montgomery County Chiropractic Center, says, “A diverse workout helps challenge the muscles in different ways. Your muscles can become conditioned to a certain workout style. As a result, it doesn't help burn fat or calories because it is too easy. Changing from cardio to swimming to weight training can help with weight loss goals.” By incorporating various exercises and adjusting her routine when she goes on tour, Dua ensures that she never misses a workout and continues to challenge her body.</p><p>Regarding her ab routine, Dua suggests including exercises like crunches and leg raises to strengthen the core. A mix of exercises can be beneficial for targeting different muscles and preventing boredom. However, it's understandable that not everyone enjoys every aspect of their workout routine, and planks seem like Dua's least favorite part. The Plank is a core part of the Dua Lipa abs workout routine.</p><h3><strong>How Does Yoga Help in Weight Loss?</strong></h3><p>Yoga can benefit a weight loss journey, although it may not directly burn as many calories as more intense cardiovascular exercises. However, it offers other ways to support weight loss and overall well-being. It helps with increased awareness, and reduction of stress and results in mindful eating (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/oby.23089","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","4","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>4</u></a>).</p><h3>.<strong>Boxing: Weight Loss and Mental Health</strong></h3><p>Boxing can positively impact both weight loss and mental health due to its combination of cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and stress-relief benefits. It is a great, high-intensity cardiovascular workout. Regular boxing sessions can contribute to creating a calorie deficit, aiding in weight loss. Punching things can work as a great stressbuster and relaxes the mind and the body (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15598276221124095","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","5","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>5</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>Plank Routine for Core Strength</strong></h3><p>A plank routine is an effective way to build core strength because planks engage multiple muscles in the core. It also activates dormant muscles in the lower back and hips. By targeting these muscles simultaneously, planks provide a comprehensive core workout (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2011/03001/The_Effect_of_Core_Training_on_Tennis_Serve.163.aspx","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","6","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>6</u></a>).</p><h2><strong>How Does Mixing Workout Routines Help in Keeping Weight Off?</strong></h2><p>Mixing workout routines helps in keeping weight off by preventing plateaus and promoting continuous progress. When you vary your exercises, your body doesn't adapt as quickly, leading to ongoing calorie burn and muscle engagement. Additionally, diverse workouts target different muscle groups, enhancing overall fitness and preventing overuse injuries. Mixing routines also reduces workout boredom as well (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Dua Lipa’s Weight Loss: Mindful Eating is the Way of Life","1238522","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13557850120078143","articlepage","/health/weight-loss/dua-lipa-weight-loss-1238522","7","Body_Hyperlink","health","weight-loss")'><u>7</u></a>).</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>Weight loss is not easy unless you dedicate yourself to it. Even losing 15 pounds can change your look and the way your body functions. Dua Lipa’s weight loss journey is proof that you can achieve your weight goal by ensuring you eat right and do not let exercise become mundane. She misses her workouts and practices yoga before starting the exercise. With proper control of mind and body, Dua ensures she has the weight where she wants it to be.
