In the video, the Iron Man actress is captured wearing a striped sweater as she walks around in Santa Monica, California, where the headquarters of her lifestyle brand Goop is located.&nbsp;</p><p>She shared, “I do something six days a week, but with a lot less intensity than I used to. Even just going for an hour's walk, or like now, I'm walking around our giant Goop office. I usually take multiple spins around to stretch my legs. But I try to do something — a little something — every day.” <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><img alt="Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man 2 (IMDb)" title="Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man 2 (IMDb)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1714312566_gwyneth-paltrow-3-1.jpg></p><p>In another question during her AMA, a fan asked Paltrow how she got to terms with her own, i.e., how she got comfortable in her own skin. In answer to this question, the actress thanked Diane von Fürstenberg for making her realize the importance of having self-positivity, revealing that the Belgian fashion designer taught her to engage in self-positive talks in the morning.&nbsp;</p><p>“Diane von Fürstenberg taught me how to do that, how to wake up in the morning and look at myself and be happy to see myself and say nice things to myself instead of terrible things to myself. She really taught me about the importance of becoming your own best friend. And that really is how you relate to yourself and things you say to yourself,” Paltrow expressed.&nbsp;</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","A Little Something Everyday&#39;: Gwyneth Paltrow Reveals Her Current Workout Routine",1300156,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/putting-things-into-turmoil-gwyneth-paltrow-reveals-son-going-off-to-college-is-giving-her-nervous-breakdown-1299380","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/a-little-something-everyday-gwyneth-paltrow-reveals-her-current-workout-routine-1300156","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","A Little Something Everyday&#39;: Gwyneth Paltrow Reveals Her Current Workout Routine",1300156,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/putting-things-into-turmoil-gwyneth-paltrow-reveals-son-going-off-to-college-is-giving-her-nervous-breakdown-1299380","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/a-little-something-everyday-gwyneth-paltrow-reveals-her-current-workout-routine-1300156",&#39;&#39;,Putting,Things,Into,Turmoil,": Gwyneth Paltrow Reveals Son Going Off To College Is Giving Her ",Nervous,Breakdown,&#39;&#39;,"Also_Read","entertainment","hollywood")'><strong>'Putting Things Into Turmoil': Gwyneth Paltrow Reveals Son Going Off To College Is Giving Her 'Nervous Breakdown'</strong></a></p><p><img alt="Gwyneth Paltrow (IMDb)" title="Gwyneth Paltrow (IMDb)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-04/1714312620_gwyneth-paltrow-4-1.jpg></p><h2 id=662f5e40558d4><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow shared that her father’s death pushed her to be fitness and wellness&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In one such AMA of <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","A Little Something Everyday&#39;: Gwyneth Paltrow Reveals Her Current Workout Routine","1300156","https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/gwyneth-paltrow-says-fans-would-be-shocked-to-discover-the-movies-she-turned-down-to-prioritize-motherhood-1297516","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/a-little-something-everyday-gwyneth-paltrow-reveals-her-current-workout-routine-1300156","Gwyneth Paltrow","Body_Hyperlink","entertainment","hollywood")'>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> in the past, one of the fans asked her how she got so much into the world of wellness. The actress then revealed that the diagnosis and the eventual death of her father by cancer made her conscious of living a healthy lifestyle. Paltrow’s father, Bruce Paltrow, died in 2002 at the age of 58 after his battle with oral cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>She revealed, “It was actually because my father was diagnosed with cancer when I was about 25 years old and that started to catalyze my foray into understanding food, environmental toxins, food as medicine [and] alternative stuff like acupuncture. So it started a long time ago ... I don’t know, in the mid-'90s, because of my dad.”</p><p>Gwyneth Paltrow’s candid responses offered fans a genuine sneak peek into her workout routine. Her admission of her father’s death motivating her to engage in health routines surely reflects her positive outlook on life and is indeed inspiring for many.&nbsp;</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","A Little Something Everyday&#39;: Gwyneth Paltrow Reveals Her Current Workout Routine",1300156,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/gwyneth-paltrow-says-fans-would-be-shocked-to-discover-the-movies-she-turned-down-to-prioritize-motherhood-1297516","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/a-little-something-everyday-gwyneth-paltrow-reveals-her-current-workout-routine-1300156","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","A Little Something Everyday&#39;: Gwyneth Paltrow Reveals Her Current Workout Routine",1300156,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/gwyneth-paltrow-says-fans-would-be-shocked-to-discover-the-movies-she-turned-down-to-prioritize-motherhood-1297516","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/a-little-something-everyday-gwyneth-paltrow-reveals-her-current-workout-routine-1300156","Gwyneth Paltrow Says Fans Would Be ",Shocked," To Discover The Movies She Turned Down To Prioritize Motherhood","Also_Read","entertainment","hollywood")'><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow Says Fans Would Be 'Shocked' To Discover The Movies She Turned Down To Prioritize Motherhood</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2BWeq21062jnmWjpLqmwMeipaBllauys8XDmrBmn6euu6bAx2anmqSkp7y4edGerZ6ZnKh6qbHRZpquqqKau7V51qippKelqXqzu9StoKedXWaAcXyQbm0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grease-rise-of-the-pink-ladies-episode-4-shows-how-societys-love-for-blame-game-can-ruin-it-all.html><span>←</span><span>'Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies' Episode 4 review: Can the ladies put on a united front?</span></a>
