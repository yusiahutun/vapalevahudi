Her witty comebacks, sharp remarks, and fearless interactions with celebrities, fans, and even political figures gained significant traction and solidified her reputation as a formidable online presence. However, in her recent interview with Ottenberg, Rihanna acknowledged that while the troll in her had its moment, she now prefers a more subtle approach.&nbsp;</p><p>Describing her current trolling style as the silent troll, Rihanna stated, as retrieved via <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Was Rihanna also a &#39;Troll&#39; in the past?

One such instance was her response to British public figure Piers Morgan, who criticized her short hair and asked the global superstar to grow her hair back quickly. Rihanna then swiftly called Morgan out in quite a witty manner by stating, “@piersmorgan: ps I think @Rihanna needs to grow her hair back. Fast." grow a d*ck..... FAST!!!!”&nbsp;</p><p>Rihanna didn't even shy away from trolling the supermodel, Kendall Jenner, who then expressed her wish to see Rihanna performing Complicated on-stage. “If Rihanna doesn’t perform Complicated tomorrow I’m gunna be very upset.” But it seemed like this wish of hers wasn’t received well by the singing sensation, who simply went ahead and asked Kendall Jenner to not show up during her performance. Rihanna swiftly replied, “Well don’t come.” One of the most sensational trolls of Rihanna has to be her interaction with singer Ciara. Rihanna called out Ciara by remarking, “Good luck with bookin that stage u speak of.”</p><br><p>As fans reminisce about Rihanna's iconic tweets and memorable interactions, it's clear that her impact on the internet is still visible. Rihanna's fearless authenticity and unapologetic attitude have surely solidified her status as an icon, both online and offline.</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Was Rihanna also a &#39;Troll&#39; in the past?
