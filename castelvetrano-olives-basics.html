This is especially true for Castelvetrano olives, which is a variety you may be new to — but will enjoy within the first bite! What makes these olives unique is their balanced salty and sweet flavor that works well in hot or cold dishes. The tender and slightly crunchy texture of these olives also makes them great for snacking. Plus, they’ll give a nice dose of healthy fats that nutrition experts say help you feel fuller, reduce inflammation and lower chronic disease risk. Keep reading to find out more about the flavor and health benefits of Castelvetrano olives, along with our favorite ways to cook with them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are olives?</h2><p>Although olives are mainly used for savory dishes, they’re actually a fruit. They belong to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Oleaceae fruit family</a> and originated in the Mediterranean <a href=# rel=noopener>at least 6,000 years ago</a>. It’s estimated that over 1,000 olive varieties exist and are grown throughout the world. Among these varieties, Castelvetrano olives standout from the rest — and for good reason.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Castelvetrano olives differ from other varieties</h2><p>Castelvetrano olives are a type of green olive from Sicily, Italy. These olives are harvested, processed and preserved in brine or oil. They’re known for their <a href=# rel=noopener>mild and buttery taste</a>, which is a stark contrast to pungent olive varieties like Kalamata and Niçoise. Castelvetrano olives also have a crisp and meaty texture that complements a variety of dishes including salads, dips, roasted meats and pastas. Another perk of noshing on Castelvetrano olives is the amazing health benefits that come with it!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The health benefits of Castelvetrano olives</h2><p>A large part of this olive variety’s nutritional benefits stem from its stores of healthy fats including <a href=# rel=noopener>monounsaturated&nbsp;fat</a>. “On the topic of healthy fats, it’s often overlooked that they keep you feeling full for longer,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Megan Lyons</a>, a certified clinical nutritionist, board-certified holistic nutritionist and the owner of <a href=# rel=noopener>The Lyons’​ Share Wellness</a>, says. “Even just a few olives, though small and relatively low in calories, can fill people up due to their healthy fats.” A snack-sized portion of 4 Castelvetrano olives contains about <a href=# rel=noopener>35 calories and nearly 4 grams of fat</a>, while the same amount of black olives has <a href=# rel=noopener>almost 18 calories and 2 grams of fat</a>. Castelvetrano olives having more monounsaturated&nbsp;fat is great news as it’s been linked with <a href=# rel=noopener>aiding weight loss and blood sugar control</a>.</p><p>Lyons notes that these olives are also brimming with omega-3 fatty acids. “These days, we hear a lot about the imbalance of omega-6 to omega-3 in the standard American diet, where most of us get too much omega-6 (which is inflammatory) and not enough omega-3 (which is anti-inflammatory),” she explains. “Olives are excellent sources of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids, which many of us lack.” Current research links the inflammation-fighting properties of omega-3’s with potentially reducing the risk of <a href=# rel=noopener>cancer, heart disease and cognitive decline</a>.</p><p>It’s worth noting that this amount of Castelvetrano olives has around 130 milligrams of sodium since it absorbs some of the brine. But, draining or even rinsing them is a way to prevent that excess salt from going into your dish.
