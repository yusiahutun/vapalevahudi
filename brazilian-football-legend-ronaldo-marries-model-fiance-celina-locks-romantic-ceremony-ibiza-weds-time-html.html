class=mol-para-with-font>One of the first people to congratulate the happy couple, who are holidaying in the Dominican Republic, was Ronaldo's ex-wife Milene Domingues.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The former footballer wrote: 'I'm happy for you. God bless and protect you always. Long live love.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It marked the third time the ex-footballer has walked down the aisle, after previously marrying former footballer Milene.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ronaldo organised a wedding with model Daniella Cicarelli in February 2005 at a castle in France, although it later transpired they did not officially become man and wife because neither had finalised their divorces from their previous partners.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They split three months after the castle ceremony they billed as an official wedding, with Daniella later claiming it ended because Ronaldo had been unfaithful to her.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After their relationship finished, he wed engineering student Maria Beatriz Antony.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ronaldo shares his son Ronald, 23, with his first wife Milene, and daughters Maria Sofia, 14, and Maria Alice, 12, with his second wife Maria.</p><p

year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In March last year Celina duped the world into believing she was pregnant with Ronaldo's fifth child.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She posted a selfie photo showing her dressed in pink with her hand on her stomach and wrote: 'A new phase of my life is beginning and with it a great responsibility.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She subsequently revealed her new 'baby' was actually a perfume she was launching as part of a beauty products range.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Confirming the couple picked Ibiza for their wedding because of their love of the island, a spokesman for Ronaldo told local press outside the church: 'He came to get married in Ibiza because he likes the island and it's important for him.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The

class=mol-para-with-font>'My goals are like my children,' he says when asked if those scored in the 2-0 World Cup final win over Germany are dearer to him than the beauties from his earlier career.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I love them all the same. You can't love one child more than another can you?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's true that the goal against SD Compostela (the run from the halfway line that astounded Robson) defined a part of my career.

He says a Ronaldo fan-site recently calculated that he had scored 90 goals in his career by going around the keeper.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It came so naturally to him, and he jokes about trying to explain the process to the players at the LaLiga club he owns, Valladolid.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In one game in my first season as president we had drawn at home but with five minutes left our right winger Keko was through and he shoots from three metres in front of the keeper — he was so desperate to get rid of the ball.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I said after the game, 'What were you doing? You had the chance there and whatever you did it was going to work out! It's so simple!</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'If you are going towards the keeper, he comes out, whatever you do you are going to be quicker than him — if you shoot one metre away from him to the right or the left the ball will go in because he can't get down quickly enough.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You can see the ball, the keeper, the goal, you can see everything, and whatever you do apart from shooting straight at him, it's going to work out'.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was affectionate and delivered with a smile, and Ronaldo is laughing now as he recalls the player's response: "Yes, but you're Ronaldo.
