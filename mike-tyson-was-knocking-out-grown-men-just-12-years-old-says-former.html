According to Atlas, Tyson weighed 86 kgs (190 pounds) and had a 20-inch neck to go with his natural ability and awesome explosive power – all at 12 years old.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking to RingTV.com on his career as a world-class trainer and comparing all the fighters he has worked with through the years, the 63-year-old Atlas said he was taken aback by what stood in front of him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/21/072d35ae-f3e5-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_1320x770_190248.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“As far as most pure, God-given talent, raw, from the earliest stage that you saw, it would have to be a 12-year-old Tyson, who was 190 pounds but no fat,” said Atlas, who was mentored by D’Amato to become a Hall of Fame trainer himself. Atlas currently trains former WBC (World Boxing Council) light heavyweight champion Oleksandr Gvozdyk and is a boxing commentator for ESPN.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Conor McGregor must ‘look inside himself’, says Mike Tyson as boxing legend offers troubled UFC star advice</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He had to impress me and Cus. He had to box his first day with a 27-year-old man who was a professional fighter, and he was able to do that. You can’t put him in with kids to spar because there are none and so you’re hiring sparring partners and they’re men and he’s hurting them and knocking them out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/10/21/e76334ee-f3e4-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_1320x770_190248.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Anyone who could be knocking out men when he’s 12, 13 years old is a pretty damn good puncher.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He learned the technique to make you miss and catch you clean but power’s power and punchers are born, not made.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But Atlas noted that Tyson’s weak spot was his will, even though “Iron Mike” had one of the strongest chins in the game.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Mike Tyson in Donnie Yen swanswong; classic Hong Kong films remastered</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Tyson had a tremendous chin and he had a helluva neck for shock absorbers. His neck was close to 20 inches. If you trace his career, he didn’t disappear straight away. He took those shots. What wasn’t strong was his will; that’s what cracked. His will cracked before his chin. He absorbed those punches and he took big punches before he got knocked out. He showed a chin to handle those punches at a very high level. His will wasn’t nearly as strong as his chin.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mm6eonruoe8Crq6KbnJp8dHySbHBqaV%2BitqyxjK2wrKeeYsSiv4ykpaibm567qHnOrqtmn6KkxK95zJ6lZqKlqMFufZFmsJ6Zoqh6sLjDZqqasaNis7C%2BzJ6p</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michael-sarrazin-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Michael Sarrazin obituary | Movies</span></a>
